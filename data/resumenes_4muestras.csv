AZTA,"Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Hello, everyone, and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Brooks Automation Q3 2019 Financial Results. Now, during today's conference all telephone participants will be in a listen-only mode, but later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Now a quick reminder, today's call is being recorded, it's August 1st, 2019.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mark Namaroff, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Mark Namaroff -- Director of Investor Relations
Thank you, David, and good afternoon everyone on the line today. We would like to welcome you to our third quarter earnings conference call for Brooks for fiscal 2019 ended June 30th.
Our earnings press release was issued after the close of the market today and is available on our Investor Relations website located at www.brooks.com as is our supplementary PowerPoint slides that we'll be using during the prepared remarks today.
I would like to remind everyone that during the course of the call we will be making a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Litigation Security Act of 1995. There are many factors that may cause actual financial results or other events to differ from those identified in such forward-looking statements. I would refer you to the section of our earnings release titled Safe Harbor statement, the Safe Harbor slide on our aforementioned PowerPoint presentation on our website, and our various filings with the SEC, including our annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. We make no obligation to update these statements should future financial data or events occur that differ from those forward-looking statements presented today.
In addition, we may refer to a number of non-GAAP financial measures, which are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations and performance. But when considered with GAAP financial results and the reconciliation of GAAP measures, they provide an even more complete understanding of our business. Non-GAAP measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of the GAAP measures themselves.
On the call with me today is our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Schwartz and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Lindon Robertson. We will open the call with remarks from Steve on our business strategy and the highlights of the third quarter then Lindon will provide a more detailed look into our quarterly financial results and provide a summary of our financial outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year ending September 30th we will then take your questions at the end of the prepared remarks.
Before turning the call over to Steve, I would like to remind everyone that we've completed the sale of our Semiconductor Cryogenics business on July 1st, the first day following the end of the third quarter on which we we're reporting. Reporting commentary -- reporting and commentary and guidance in this quarter focuses on our continuing operations.
And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Schwartz.
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon to everyone on the call with us today. We're pleased to report to you on a solid progress against our 2019 objectives and to have the chance to provide you with some color as to what we see for the remainder of this year.
Revenue in the June quarter was $204 million, up 3% sequentially with positive contributions from Life Sciences and Semiconductor meaningfully. Even in a weak semiconductor capital equipment environment, we grew our semiconductor business quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was up 18%, mostly from the addition of GENEWIZ and organic growth in Sample Management. This increase in Life Sciences more than compensated for the relatively modest 5% decrease in semiconductor, which was our first year-over-year decline in this cycle. With this positive momentum as a backdrop, we report the results of our June quarter and we've reemphasize that for the foreseeable future our focus will continue to be on growth and margin expansion.
Our markets provide tremendous opportunity to achieve both of these objectives, and we're focused on execution to make sure that we deliver on the promise of this strong portfolio. As you are aware, we have two growth businesses made up of several sub-sectors, each with their own unique growth characteristics. This portfolio allows more dependable growth even with variability in each sub-sector, which will be evident in the examples we illustrate today. I'll begin with Life Sciences.
Our Life Sciences revenue came in at $88 million, up 77% from one year ago, made up of $37 million contribution from GENEWIZ and 5% organic growth from Sample Management. We remain particularly pleased with the execution at GENEWIZ, which is on a trajectory for 20% growth this year. In the quarter GENEWIZ delivered record revenue from each of its three major service lines, Sanger sequencing, next generation sequencing, and gene synthesis, an incredible customer capture adding more than 140 new customer accounts. Sequential revenue growth of $4 million, or 13%, in one quarter is a testament to the momentum we have in the GENEWIZ business as well as the ability of the company to expand quickly.
Our GENEWIZ business is also set up for good fourth quarter. We're growing at rates above 30% in our San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, and Continental European sites, and we're investing to expand our physical footprint in our two largest sites, New Jersey and Suzhou, China, to make sure that we can stay ahead of the opportunity that's unfolding in front of us. Overall GENEWIZ is demonstrating exceptional growth and the level of customer capture that will lead to more upside potential. Most importantly, we continue to develop new processes and services that are enabling breakthroughs in the new science of cell and gene therapy. Needless to say, these are busy and exciting times at GENEWIZ.
In Sample Management, we delivered 5% organic year-over-year growth, slower than last quarter and below the expectations we had coming into the quarter, but with market penetration indicators continuing to support a more robust growth rate. Specifically, in the June quarter we booked another $60 million and we added another 45 new customers. Yet we delivered only $51 million in revenue. And though, we continue our strong customer capture and year-to-date we've built almost $20 million in additional backlog, we've not been as effective in converting these wins to revenue.
We're keenly focused on addressing our slower revenue growth, but we believe it will take us a couple of quarters to see meaningful progress. So until we put some real points on the board, we'll guide to a similar pace of revenue growth and flattish gross margin profile. We don't accept these levels are satisfactory, but we do require systemic solutions before we can instill confidence in our forecast.
We remain enthusiastic and confident in this tremendous opportunity presented by this business segment. There is no shortage of market interest, and we certainly have orders that can sustain higher growth. At issue here is that we've guided growth at a rate that the market opportunity and business capture could support but operationally could not deliver, and we will fix this.
Before I move to the results for Semiconductor, I do want to highlight that we have continued to see more signs of meaningful adoption of our ultra-cold cryo products for management of some of the most valuable samples in the cold chain. In Q3, we shipped 12 [Indecipherable] units primarily for cell and gene therapy sample management applications and four units for IVF clinics where our solutions offer unprecedented Sample protection and security that's required for high-value biological samples.
In addition, we shipped our second unit of a fully automated single sample handling cryo storage system to a large pharmaceutical company in Europe. The driver here is the management of cells for cell and gene therapy development, the same driver that's the source for much of the growth opportunity in our GENEWIZ business.
Revenue from the cryo products was $2.5 million, our biggest quarter thus far, and we have a backlog of orders which is strengthening as customers recognize the value of our highly differentiated automated solutions. We're beginning to see a higher level of repeat orders from existing customers, and we believe that we're nearing a tipping point for the adoption of our automated cryo sample management solutions.
Overall, we anticipate another growth quarter in Life Sciences. As I mentioned, we remain bullish, but we'll be a bit cautious on Sample Management guidance as we need some time to make sure we get traction, but we do expect growth in both Life Sciences sub-sectors in the September quarter.
Now let's move to the Semiconductor business segment where the results were once again strong, while somewhat counterintuitive and certainly worthy of some explanation. We had a very strong June quarter with revenue up 3% sequentially and up only 5% from the same quarter one year ago, which was our peak. Overall, year-to-date, we are still up 5% for the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 compared to the same period one year ago significant outperformance we think when compared to most of the semiconductor capital equipment space.
Once again, we have some unique dynamics, which are noteworthy as it relates to the growth that's provided by our portfolio. Because of our position in Contamination Control Solutions in advanced packaging applications, two secular growth drivers, we've been guiding that we had confidence that we could outgrow the semiconductor capital equipment market by 2 percentage points to 4 percentage points. What we've seen in reality is that the market adoption of these two capabilities has been even more dramatic propelling us to a higher level of outperformance relative to the space. Furthermore, we believe that this inertia will continue for the foreseeable technology nodes.
Now to some specifics. Similar to what we reported last quarter, our vacuum robot business continued to be consistent with the lower level of shipments for our Tier 1 OEM customers. That said, we did see a sequential increase of 16% but off of a low level, and we forecast another sequential increase in vacuum robot revenue in the September quarter which gives some indication that inventory seems to have been burned off and that this may be the start of some sustained increased activity, albeit at levels that are still well below peak levels for 2018.
Automation Systems business was up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year with Tier 2 OEM business as the driver. Once again Advanced Packaging proved to be a star delivering another record quarter at $19 million, up 16% from last quarter and up 21% year-over-year. Year-to-date our $53 million in Advanced Packaging revenue is just shy of the $56 million we delivered in the entire fiscal year of 2018. And we had another very solid quarter from our Contamination Control business with revenue of $29 million, down slightly from the $30 million we delivered last quarter, but up 34% from the June quarter one year ago.
It's important to note that although we are pleased by the steady performance of the CCS business, we are not surprised that it's outperforming the semiconductor capital equipment space. As we've highlighted to you over the past years, this relatively recent technology addition is a key to yield improvement because of the advanced chemistries that are now required to produce state-of-the-art integrated circuits. We foresee demand for our CCS products continuing to increase in the future.
Specifically, we know how the industry has rapidly adopted these technologies as measured by the breadth of our customer base. In just the last five years we more than doubled the number of CCS customers to more than 60, with customers distributed across foundry, logic, memory, and many other applications. We now have customers in every geographic region, and what may be a surprise, our greatest number of CCS customers are in China. So for a business that originally was almost solely dependent on top tier foundry, we've established a broad technology base with global presence. Contamination Control Solutions are here to stay, and we are exactly in the right spot to address these critical customer needs. And as I'll mention in a moment, we are poised for yet another leg up in this business.
As we move to our outlook for the Semiconductor business for the next two quarters, we believe that it's useful to let you know how we are processing the signals that are coming from our customers and why we think our September quarter might be a bottom for our Semiconductor business.
After a record June quarter for China business, which was the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue increases from China, we anticipated slowing of some of our automated systems business in our September forecast. That said our share position is very strong, our design activity remains perfectly intact, and we're extremely well positioned for continued successful business in China. We believe that this slowdown is the result of some of the trade restrictions that are impacting Chinese investments in the near future.
That said, we forecast our vacuum robot business to increase again in the September quarter meaningfully. The majority of the increase is for robots to Tier 1 OEM tools that will ship to logic and foundry applications. Shipments to Tier 1 OEM customers for memory will remain at lower levels. Advanced Packaging, although still difficult to forecast, remains a secular driver and we believe it will still hold up compared to the front-end equipment shipments.
And finally, we have strong signals about the expansion of our Contamination Control Solutions business as order activity has been particularly robust in the past weeks. Based on our backlog and customer delivery requests, we predict that the December quarter will be a record quarter for CCS. As we're already at risk of selling out of capacity in the December quarter, we worked to pull some of the CCS demand into the September quarter so that we can avoid capacity constraints that could occur in December.
So in the near term, these mixed market segment behaviors in combination reduced our semiconductor forecast for the September quarter, but we're bullish about a pickup in December. That said, we could see a 5% to 10% drop quarter-over-quarter from the June quarter to the September quarter. Overall, we're in a very strong position for continued growth. Life Sciences markets are robust and Semiconductor appears to be stabilizing. Our focus in the September quarter will be on the improvement of the Sample Management revenue conversion and preparation for the potential for a meaningful increase in our Semiconductor business in December.
Finally, I want to comment on the implications of our completed sale of the Semiconductor Cryogenics business unit. As you're aware, during the past few quarters, we were busy executing on two sizable transactions, the sale of our semiconductor cryo vacuum business and the acquisition of GENEWIZ. But during this period, we did not stop exploring next target opportunities. The addition of GENEWIZ puts us decidedly into the science of genomics and dramatically increases not only the size of our available market but also the size and number of acquisition targets that could be valuable contributors and good fits with our offerings. We believe that we have a strong pipeline of target opportunities that can add significant value to shareholders, combined with a strong balance sheet that will enable us to execute on these opportunities if and when they become available.
That concludes my formal remarks, and I'll now turn the call over to Lindon for more specifics about the quarter and our outlook for Q4.
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Steve. I now draw your attention to slide 3 of the presentation materials. Summarizing the third quarter highlights, which Steve has already touched on, the quarter provided growth and margin expansion, 3% sequential growth in both segments with benefits from a well-rounded portfolio, and operating margin expansion in both segments and for total Brooks on a sequential and a year-over-year basis.
The subsequent closure of the sale of the Cryogenics business has enabled us to reset the balance sheet. On July 1st we collected the proceeds from the sale, used a portion to substantially reduce our debt, and increased our available cash by approximately $55 million. I will also highlight that we received an upgrade from one of the credit rating agencies this month. The strength of our balance sheet, improvement in our portfolio, and our track record, all contributed to this.
Additional opportunities have us very excited. We've continued to accumulate significant incremental design wins in semiconductors. We had a total of 188 million -- I'm sorry, 188 new customers added to the Life Sciences segment just in this quarter, and we are supporting investments in geographic expansion for GENEWIZ in Europe, in China, and in North America. These are all strong opportunities as we move forward, and of course, we have the balance sheet to acquire additional capabilities and customer relationships with a continuous focus on the pipeline of potential acquisitions.
Let's move on to slide 4 to see and discuss the Company overall results. Our total revenue of $204 million grew 18% this quarter compared with Q3 last year and grew 3% sequentially. As already highlighted, both segments expanded sequentially and there are several exciting growth dynamics, which I will summarize as we get to each segment. On a year-over-year view, we have significant growth driven by the addition of GENEWIZ, which we acquired in November, 5% organic growth in Sample Management, and a 5% decline in Semiconductor Solutions, which is still strong performance relative to our industry peers.
Looking at our GAAP earnings, we're reporting $0.10 earnings per share on a total company basis. As a reminder, that sale of the Semiconductor Cryogenics business closed on July 1, the day after the third quarter finished. So the discontinued operations contributed $0.09 to the total GAAP earnings. On a continuing operations basis, we had net earnings of $0.01 per diluted share, which is $0.05 above the prior quarter. As you can see, revenue growth combined with gross margin expansion and expense management provided for healthy operating margin expansion.
Looking below operating income on the GAAP side still, interest expense was stable sequentially, [Indecipherable] favorable health of $9 million this quarter in the sequential comparison due to the debt extinguishment cost in the prior quarter. Offsetting this an $8 million increase in the GAAP based tax expense. The increased tax charges reflect a late regulation change in this quarter related to the transition toll tax under the Tax Reform Act. While this change drove additional expense of $4 million, it did not affect the cash taxes paid.
Let's shift focus to the non-GAAP results on the right side to get a clear view of our performance during the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margins for the quarter were 42.4% for the company, an improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year, driven by strength in both Semiconductor and Life Sciences. On a sequential basis, you will also see continued improvement of 40 basis points.
Non-GAAP operating margins reached 12.7%, expanding 90 basis points sequentially and year-over-year, driven by improved gross margins and operating leverage in the business. The leverage you see in the quarter-to-quarter sequential comparison is all performance driven, while those dynamics you see in the year-over-year comparison include the mix impact of adding GENEWIZ to the business along with the performance improvements in Sample Management and in Semiconductor Solutions. The total result is 27% growth in operating income on just 18% growth in revenue.
Looking below operating income on a sequential basis, again we had a full quarter of comparable interest expense in both Q2 and Q3, but on a year-over-year basis, the interest expense increased by $6 million, masking the progress in operating margins. As disclosed previously, we have reduced debt by approximately 90% on July 1 following the closure of the divestiture, which will eliminate most of the interest expense.
To wrap up on the non-GAAP P&L discussion, I highlight that the $0.20 earnings per share is a 16% improvement over the second quarter. While it is down $0.01 year-over-year, this quarter was burdened by higher interest expense, which we have now reduced significantly going forward, and the EBITDA measure growing 9% sequentially and 30% year-over-year, that's particularly helpful this quarter in viewing the progress and profitability without the interest in the tax dynamics.
Moving on to slide 5, let's review Life Sciences. Revenue for Life Sciences in the third quarter was $88 million, up 77% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of GENEWIZ and the 5% organic growth in Sample Management. Overall, we remain very pleased with the business direction and the opportunities.
Let's hit the highlights of GENEWIZ first and then I will also address the slower growth in Sample Management revenue relative to expectations. This is the second full quarter of ownership of GENEWIZ. So it is the first opportunity to check the performance picture for momentum under the Brooks umbrella. And the momentum is strong, turning in $37 million in revenue and providing 13% sequential growth, which was well supported across the platform of Sanger based sequencing and next generation sequencing as well as in the gene synthesis offerings. The revenue momentum correlates with that addition of the customers, which Steve highlighted.
In Sample Management, revenue came in at $51 million, which reflects 5% organic growth from the prior year. In total, most all Sample Management business lines grew year-over-year, but performance or slower than forecasted. As Steve highlighted, we saw a nice ramp in the automated B III Cryo systems, and though these systems remain small with just $2.5 million in revenue, we are encouraged by the growth, the expansion of the customer base, and the repeat orders.
On the flipside, large automated store systems revenue remained challenged, down 11% year-over-year in the third quarter. We had previously described a line of sight to a higher number, but were impacted in the quarter by delays in certain anticipated orders, which would have converted to revenue during the period and also had some issues in customer site readiness for system installations. We have implemented changes and expect improvements in managing these challenges.
Total Life Science gross margins were 43.3%, 70 basis points up from the second quarter. This reflected GENEWIZ gross margins of 51%, up 160 basis points from the second quarter performance and Sample Management gross margin softening 70 basis points, still rounding into 38%. The 510 basis-point expansion from Q3 a year ago primarily reflects the favorable mix impact of adding GENEWIZ to the portfolio.
Looking at operating profit. We also see 500 basis points expansion year-over-year driven by the mix effect of GENEWIZ and performance improvement in Sample Management. We also see strong margin expansion of 120 basis points compared to the second quarter as income grew 23% to $6.2 million. Looking forward, we see continued revenue expansion in the fourth quarter. We expect that the momentum of GENEWIZ to contribute growth and are continuing on a more modest level of growth in Sample Management -- or counting on a more modest level of Sample Management, I should say.
We are targeting total Life Science revenue to be $90 million or better in the fourth quarter. Life Science revenue in the fiscal year is now expected to be in the range of $330 million. This is comprised of GENEWIZ landing an approximate 20% growth for the year when compared to 2018 prior to our ownership and an organic growth of approximately 7% in Sample Management for the fiscal year. We will continue guiding Sample Management expectations more conservatively until we demonstrate consistent improvement.
Let's turn to the Semiconductor business on slide 6. As a reminder, we present these results on a continuing operations basis. Revenue improved 3% sequentially this quarter to $116 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was down 5%. This reflects the significant slowdown in Tier 1 customer demand consistent with the industry. Offsetting this, to achieve the overall results, we saw growth in various areas, and as Steve highlighted, these included vacuum systems, Advanced Packaging, Contamination Control Solutions, and then on a sequential basis, the vacuum robots going into Tier 1 also saw an uptick in revenue.
I would like to highlight the results of the reticle stocker business which we acquired in April of 2018 for a $16 million purchase price. In the past 12 months, in a low cycle of the Semiconductor CapEx business, we've exceeded $34 million of revenue in the reticle stocker business. As Steve indicated, the increase in design wins and qualifications provide promising opportunities across our Contamination Control offerings, including both FOUP cleaners and reticle stockers.
On the gross margin line, we saw improvement of 10 basis points, compared to second quarter, and 80 basis points year-over-year. The continued stability in year-over-year improvements here reflect the transformative value of diversifying our portfolio into new and higher value product offerings and providing applications into Tier 2 OEMs and fab end users. This gross margin expansion, combined with expense controls, resulted in better-than-balanced growth at the operating income line with margin expansion on both compares, sequentially and year-over-year.
Let's turn to slide 7, which summarizes our cash flow. In the quarter, we produced $36 million of operating cash. This was up from $16 million in the second quarter. CapEx was a normal $6 million, consistent with last quarter, and resulting in free cash flow of $30 million. We paid out $7 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter and finished the quarter by adding $20 million of net cash to the balance sheet to arrive at a total of $160 million of cash and marketable securities. In the acquisition and debt lines, the year-to-date cash flow statement includes the sourcing of funds through debt to make the GENEWIZ acquisition on November 15th. You will not see the pay down of the debt until the year-end financial statements since we closed the Cryo sale and reduced debt on July 1, the first day of the fourth quarter.
Let's move on to the balance sheet on slide 8. There were no significant movements on the balance sheet inside the quarter. Inventories decreased as did trade payables. As I just noted, the debt balance will be substantially reduced when we report next quarter. With the divestiture closing, we received payment of the cash price on July 1. We estimate that net proceeds will land at $550 million after we settle taxes and fees associated with the transaction. We have applied the majority of the $550 million to reduce debt by $495 million and have kept the remainder in cash.
I can net this out to say that as we entered the fourth quarter, we have approximately $215 million of cash and cash equivalents available for use in operations and investments, while only carrying $52 million of gross debt.
Let's turn to slide 9 and look at the guidance for our fourth quarter fiscal -- fourth fiscal quarter of 2019. We expect overall revenue to be in the range of $192 million to $200 million. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.26. Given results to date for 2019, we now expect the full year to be approximately $775 million in revenue, and we believe this will bring $0.75 to $0.80 of non-GAAP earnings per share.
This has Life Sciences revenue at about $330 million and Semiconductor Solutions at approximately $445 million. With the significant changes in the portfolio completed this year, the growth and the potential for leverage we have built into the business segments, and with our reset of the balance sheet that sets up for another chapter of investment. We invite you to join us for the Investor Day on September 17th, the New York City. As always, the lines will be open to join from wherever you are sitting.
So this concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn call back over to the operator to take questions from the line.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. First question coming from the line of Craig Ellis. You may now proceed.
Craig Ellis -- B. Riley & Co., LLC -- Analyst
Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on closing the sale and cleaning up the balance sheet, guys. So I wanted to start just by making sure I understood the dynamics going on within Sample Management within the Life Sciences segment. So with respect to the reset in growth expectations, is that really impacting the systems business or the services business or both of those businesses?
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So Craig, it's actually impacting both of the businesses. The systems business was down and the Sample Management portion of the business, the storage portion of the business, although still growing, was slower than we experienced over the past couple of quarters.
Craig Ellis -- B. Riley & Co., LLC -- Analyst
And Steve, what is it that you're looking at as you make changes to that business to close the gap back with where you think the businesses' growth should be relative to industry growth? What are some milestones that we can look at -- look at over the coming quarters that will help us see that that's getting back on the proper growth trajectory?
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so Craig, a couple things. One, we need to -- as you're aware, we need to continue to manage the dependability of the stores business. This is something that's ought to be a little bit more in our control. We did have some impact of ability to get some systems booked to be able to recognize revenue, but still the drop is bigger than the causes from the lack of bookings, which actually will fall into this quarter. It's more about operational issues, how do we make sure that we stay on track, delivering the tools to the customers on time. So that's one that's really operational issues for us to manage.
And in the Sample Management, again, we think the bookings and the order patterns are still strong. The variability in that business comes from things that are associated with the alliance on the genomic side of that business, the non-GENEWIZ stuff, the things that we run through Rutgers [Phonetic], and our ability to get samples registered and manage the ins and outs of the customer requests on that business.
So that for us feels strong from a backlog standpoint. That's just we see -- we saw something a little bit unusual in this particular quarter, but still the sample counts are coming in. The growth in that business is generally good. It's the peripheral portions of that that are different from the BioStorage Sample Management, but rather the touches that we have on those samples and the peripheral things related to the alliance revenue and transport, if you will, that kept us from having as robust a growth rate.
So again, things that are better for us to manage, some of the issues associated with the sample counts, as long as we continue to win sample business, continue to register them over the long term, that will be a good, steady growth business for us.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Paul Knight. You may now proceed.
Paul Knight -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Hey, Steve. How big is an automated store system shipment one project?
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
On a big sample store, it's roughly $1 million tool, if you will, and on a BioStore III Cryo it's a $100,000 to $150,000 kind of tool.
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And Paul, I would ...
Paul Knight -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
And can you give us a little history? Is it the automated store system that's the biggest problem or can you talk to that?
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Paul, let me add in. So a typical shipment it may be a single store that would be $1 million, but it's not unusual for us to have a call it a $1 million to $3 million project with a customer where it might be an extra-long store or it might be multiple stores on the large side. We're still handling the smaller B III Cryos more in single and sometimes shipping two or three at a time.
But those aren't the challenged. The bigger -- the challenge is on the large store systems. So in getting projects to yield, I'll just add a couple of comments on this. We had a situation where we had inventory in hand and that we were starting to tune it toward specific customer opportunities, and in fact, we have been able to get booking, but wasn't able to get it inside the quarter. So we had a line of sight to it, but we didn't achieve it in the quarter. We had confidence of getting it, but we didn't get it.
And we've had project delays relative to customer sites and installation costs were impacted as a result of that. So the issues compound themselves a bit. We see a path to work and improve our way out of this. And when I say that, we recognize we've said that for a couple of times over the past year, and so we're going to be a little more conservative in calling it.
But I would emphasize, these are significant opportunities that continue to come to us. We have a good pipeline of opportunities that we're working currently, really good opportunities, and it's expanded. Sometimes we have more opportunity in Europe than in the US and sometimes it's the other way around. And in the past year, it's increased in China as well. So we're encouraged on the breadth of the opportunity continuing to expand, but we've got to get better at the execution.
Paul Knight -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Okay, thank you.
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah.
Operator
Next question is coming up from the line of Amanda Scarnati. You may now proceed
Amanda Scarnati -- Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On the semiconductor side, we've been hearing from a couple of players in this space that the logic and foundry business is becoming a little bit more two half weighted this year and seeing a little bit more strength there. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the sector and how that plays into your guidance for down 5% to 10% in the September quarter with growth in the December quarter?
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Hi, Amanda, this is Steve. So as you said and as everybody has started to give indications, logic and foundry feel like second half pickup. And as I mentioned, we have some vacuum robot pickup. The decrease for us in the quarter is likely related to some of the Tier 2 foundry and particularly the opportunities that have been feeding revenue here for the last quarters related to business in China. So without question, there's a pause there, but we still continue to see strength in Contamination Control in Advanced Packaging, and as I mentioned, a slight pickup in vacuum robots for the second consecutive quarter. But on the systems business, particularly related to China, we're going to see that slow in the September quarter. That said, as I mentioned, we have a pretty significant backlog build here in the Contamination Control with request for really significant deliveries in the December quarter.
Amanda Scarnati -- Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. -- Analyst
And then I think you also mentioned that with the CCS business that you might pull some of that into September quarter. Was that also built into that down 5% to 10% or would that be something that would happen later on in the quarter in addition to today's guidance?
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Our best estimates are factored in right now into what the September and December quarters look like.
Amanda Scarnati -- Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. -- Analyst
And then the last question I just have, if I can, is on the margin expansion in the Life Sciences business. And what seems to be somewhat reasonable in that market? I know the Street, and myself included, are modeling quite substantial pickup in margins in that business and haven't really seen it yet. So if you could just talk a little bit about the margin trajectory in that business?
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, Amanda, I'll talk about that, and of course, it tends to be in aggregation of both Sample Management and GENEWIZ what we've told, frankly, on the operating margin line, we do see the trajectory of the models to be quite comparable over the longer term. When I say longer term, we'll give more of an update on that for -- in our Investor Day.
But as we see volatility, for example, in Sample Management, it dropped down, and while we saw acceleration, 13% growth, we got nice leverage out of GENEWIZ when we look at them separately. So in total they came to 7%, both positive year-over-year improvements I should say on the Sample Management and GENEWIZ contributing nicely.
But if I move up to the gross margin, I've highlighted before, GENEWIZ expected to range between 47% to 51%. We're at the high-end of that range, and that has quite a bit to do with the period of investment and the utilization of that investment, and whether we have utilizing it with a high percentage of capacity utilization, and it's not a number that I can size or a metric that I can hit for you. But as we make those assets and investments productive and people productive, because we make resources in -- are there in place.
Obviously on the gross margin side of Sample Management, I anticipate improvements there. As Steve said, our guidance has factored in a more flat gross margin around 38%. We still see the objective to be in a reasonable time period be 42% to 44%, and we have convictions to get there, but in the near term what I've put in here is about the 40% -- I'm sorry, the 38% range.
So let me pause, see if I addressed your question. If you want to ask more, feel free.
Amanda Scarnati -- Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. -- Analyst
No, I think that's great. Thank you.
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Thanks, Amanda.

[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho. You may now proceed.
Patrick Ho -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Steve, maybe just following up on some of your commentary about the softening with the Tier 2 players in China, which sounds reasonable given the capacity build that they've had over the last several quarters. Can you give a little color in terms of your progress working with the local Chinese equipment OEMs? As that industry starts to kind of grow, you've got major players already like AMAK [Phonetic], but what's your I guess penetration or what's your efforts there in getting into some of those companies?
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Patrick, at last count, we had 13 OEM companies in China that were customers of ours. So we see continued expansion. Whenever they win a new design, whenever they win an application, we have a vacuum robot for sure, in a lot of instances we have a vacuum system. We also have some atmospheric systems business there. And that's probably more because we can get them to market very quickly with the technology that will be accepted by the fab.
So the breadth is really strong. The amount of design activity that we dedicated to China over the past couple years has been significant, and we see from a market share, market position standpoint, we're extremely strong in China, again because newcomers can focus on their process technology and have a very dependable process tool when they -- when they ship it into a fab, and it's especially important when it sits next to a tool from one of the Tier 1 OEMs that just have to perform.
Patrick Ho -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. -- Analyst
Great, that's helpful. And maybe moving to the Life Sciences side of things on the Sample Management and some of the operational issues you've mentioned in delivering the systems to customers. Is this something that's supply chain related procurement of parts or is it more just I guess your own internal operations are putting a system together and then delivering it to the customer?
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, Patrick, I'll tackle that. I'm not going to suggest that we never have a supply chain issue. In fact, if you went back couple of years ago we -- that was a pretty systemic issue for us, but we managed that. A year ago we managed through redundant cost of moving some of that supply chain in house. But what's hitting us right now is [Indecipherable], and I think the manufacturing and supply chain team has demonstrated some improvements there. We got to those root issues. But it's more about the project management from the build to the install and getting projects completed. And some of that is managing the timing, coordination between us and customers, some of it is getting shipments out. So while it's execution to get it out the door, I'd say probably two-thirds of the issue is at the customer delivery side. That's a significant part of the cost. As you're setting up the system, you pack up the system, you ship it, and that's where the actual assembly takes place.
I don't put it all of that at the feet of that customer site. So this is a management issue. Our project management team is well in tune with the importance of getting this fixed. We've made some changes to address it specific to project management and to the granularity of that management process, and it's got a lot of attention on it. So I think we expect to see progress, and I would encourage our investor base to expect that progress.
And all I'm suggesting is in our financial guidance. We haven't taken it into the guidance yet, because we're not going to disappoint you again. So we're going to deliver on what we put on the page, and hopefully as we can work our way above that, we'll start to pleasantly surprise, and then we'll start working our way back up to the longer-term projections.
Patrick Ho -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. -- Analyst
Okay, great. And maybe then as my final question, following up on those comments, Lindon. Is this one of the key drivers for the Sample Management gross margin expansion trajectory that you're talking about? If you get some of these issues fixed, you can get to start pushing it past 40% to start. Is this a big component of it?
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It's a portion, yes, but it's also the growth. So as we grow, we gain really good leverage on both gross margin and particularly operating margin. Where we are in the curve on operating margin is highly leverageable. So we'll see gross margin come with growth in sample storage services, in particular in our [Indecipherable] sites and our related sites around that business, but also in the full utilization of resources and fixed cost around the store system.
So, yes, project management is a little -- is a bit of the issue currently on making expectations on both delivery and systems revenue, but also in the longer term I'll get leverage out of gross margin to get us up to the 42% plus level. It'll include the growth equation.
Patrick Ho -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. -- Analyst
Great. Thank you very much.
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Patrick.
Operator
We have a follow-up question from the line of Craig Ellis. You may now proceed.
Craig Ellis -- B. Riley & Co., LLC -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks for taking the follow-up question, and it's really a clarification and then a question. So the clarification, at least versus my models, Lindon, operating expense came in about $3 million better in the quarter. So the question was what drove the positive variance?
And then secondly and more forward looking. We've got some different things happening by segment in the outlook where Semi is declining for cyclical reasons that I think we all understand, but I suspect that would have pressure on Semi gross margins on the volume side. Is there anything that we need to be aware of, positive or negative, with Life Sciences gross margins as we think about the gives and takes quarter-on-quarter?
And then as it relates to operating expense. I think we've expected that there would be some rightsizing in Semi after the Cryo sale. And are we starting to see that? And if so, to what magnitude? And if not, when would we start to see that impact the business? Thank you.
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Hey, Craig, stay on the line with us, because I'm going to do the best I can on that string of questions, but I'd like you to the press me if I don't get to it all.
Yeah, in the operating expense results that you've seen, we had some improvement from some modest reductions, but we also had some reduction of variable compensation expenses from Q2 to Q3. And then in the saying that we've also had some rationalization of integration.
So I will highlight that on that path of progress. While we realize some reductions, I wouldn't say that we've had the heaviest effort yet to offload some of the stranded cost that you and I would think of in terms of selling this Cryo business. We have put something -- some actions in place and yielded some, but we'll have more to do there, and that's both in the cost base line as well as the SG&A line going forward. We'll provide a more fulsome update at the -- at the Investor Day.
So let me pause and help me fill in the blanks with the rest of your questions.
Craig Ellis -- B. Riley & Co., LLC -- Analyst
Yeah, I think that really addresses it on the operating expense side. And then the other part of the question was really gross margins and gives and takes as we think about the fiscal fourth quarter?
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Well, in the fourth quarter, we do see a little softer margin in Semi, but we see some improvement overall in Life Science. Now in the Life Science margin, I'm not counting on improvement in the baseline of Sample Management store systems. We do see a modest mix impact there that will help us modestly, but more so the mix toward the margin of GENEWIZ will help us a bit. So overall we're seeing relatively stable gross margins overall for the business in our forecast, and that's going to -- yes, that will have an impact on us as we see just a little softer revenue.
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Up next we have John Pitzer. You may now proceed.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC -- Analyst
Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. First of all on the Semi side, makes a lot of sense that foundry is coming in better. I'm just kind of curious your view on memory. If you could remind us again kind of in the Semi business you're split between memory/foundry, logic and as you look at memory business trends, the September quarter in your mind kind of represent a bottom. Customers are through the inventory burn. Customers' bookings levels aren't going lower. How do we think about memory trending from here?
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, John, I'll take a stab at it. We do the best we can on this. We generally know from a OEM tool standpoint the type of tool, but we don't have a 100% precision if it's memory or logic. But we do know that the drivers lately have been for -- the drivers of the uptick have been for foundry and some logic. So that part we feel pretty comfortable about.
On the Contamination Control Solutions we're pretty clear. So that's a very low level of memory. But one thing I will tell you is, of the 60 plus customers that we have in the CCS business, nine Are foundry, 10 are memory. And although they don't buy the same quantities of tools. We know that when memory picks up, we'll start to see it. So we'll get a feel for that when we start to see it.
So I would guess that at the low levels where we are, this ought to be somewhere near a bottom, but I wouldn't -- I'd be hard pressed to tell you when we think that might pick up.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC -- Analyst
That's helpful. And then guys on the Life Science side, as you go through, for perhaps a lack of a better term, some of the growing pains here, I appreciate that you don't want to put a timeline on kind of some of the corrective measures. But are we talking sort of quarter, quarter-and-a-half, multiple quarters? How do we think about kind of time to resolution on some of the logistical issues?
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
So, John, for sure we want to be able to demonstrate some -- we want to be able to demonstrate some improvements here within a couple of quarters. So I would imagine that by the December quarter, we'd be able to demonstrate results that show that we're, that we're making significant improvements. I remind you that it's not the growth rates we had anticipated. We did 5% organic year-over-year growth. But our expectations, backlog, capability, capacity or for higher than that. And we -- it's going to take us a couple of quarters, but it's not going to take us a year to be making improvements here that you can see.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC -- Analyst
And as the improvements begin to materialize on the top line, how do we think about kind of the operating margin leverage in this business?
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
On the leverage side of Life Sciences, it's probably good to take you back to the leverage you're seeing in this quarter. So 7% was up a point, we're up 3% and which was roughly about $2 million plus quarter-to-quarter. So we do see that kind of leverage occurring as we go through. A piece of that was gross margin improvement, about 0.70 point driven on the GENEWIZ side, but again that's because we are utilizing that fixed cost base was services personnel being fully utilized.
So we think that we'll continue to see that type of leverage as we move forward. And as I highlighted, John, Sample Management as it turns back toward a [Indecipherable] expansion, we'll see leverage on that side as well. So while we're sitting at 7% today, we see continued progress in improving operating margins even in the fourth fiscal quarter.
John Pitzer -- Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC -- Analyst
Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, John.
Operator
And we have a follow-up question from the line of Paul Knight. You may now proceed.
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Paul.
Paul Knight -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Hey, Steve. Can you talk about how much the backlog in Life Science grew year-over-year? And then secondly, how big is the stores business?
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Paul, just one second on the backlog. We're taking a look. And Paul, the stores business on an annual basis is kind of running around $30 million run rate.
Paul Knight -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Got it.
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
So Paul, we highlighted a build roughly of $20 million in the remarks, and I just confirmed that's right at what I'm seeing year-over-year basis. And I've got to emphasize, that's a Sample Management metric. So we don't identify or track backlog in GENEWIZ as it's highly transactional. So clearly, we finished the quarter with orders on the books for GENEWIZ, but we're not tracking the backlog the same. So it has built and it has increased, which gives us encouragement. Obviously, a challenge for us is to drop it to the bottom line for revenue growth.
Paul Knight -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Would it be fair to say the double-digit backlog on Life Science or no?
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
On a growth basis year-over-year?
Paul Knight -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Yeah.
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Let me just make sure. I guess I'm not going to declare its double-digit growth on total. There is going to be double-digit growth in elements of the Life Sciences backlog, but I can't say that in total. In the total it's not quite double-digit. It went from about $265 million to $275 million range.
Paul Knight -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Okay.
Lindon G. Robertson -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I'm sorry, $265 million to $280 million range. Sorry.
Paul Knight -- Janney Montgomery Scott LLC -- Analyst
Okay, thanks.
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah
Operator
All right, there appears to be no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to you.
Stephen S. Schwartz -- President and Chief Executive Officer
All right, operator. And everyone, thank you for joining the call. We know that there is some intensity here on the Sample Management business. Let me kind of wrap up with a highlight. We've had about 55% of our business here in the Semi business significantly outperform the market on a year-to-date basis. It's quite remarkable. This has been the first quarter of decline in many quarters for us on the Semi side, and it's just down 5% off of the peak last year.
In the GENEWIZ business, while it's a new addition, it's got the momentum, quarter-to-quarter up 13%. It set records in each of the platform that they are rolling out and had serviced for many years.
And then the Sample Management, while we have a keen focus on it, it's got a 5% organic growth year-over-year. And as I said, the estimate for the year is about 7% organic growth. It's below our expectations, [Indecipherable], we're going to fix it. The interest that you all show is both encouraging to us and also reminds us the responsibility to deliver these results. So we look at this guidance and we have confidence in it. We're very straightforward with you and we appreciate the interest.
More importantly, we're excited about change in the portfolio, the reset of the balance sheet to continue to make certain investments as we move forward, and we look forward to the Investor Day where we'll lay out this in a more complete, comprehensive picture, and you could talk with our general management. So please do join us. And we really appreciate your attention and your time today. So thank you and we look forward to seeing you at Investor Day.

AAPL,"Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Good day everyone. Welcome to the Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.
Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speaks as of their respective dates.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $91.8 billion, which is above the high end of our guidance range, with revenue growth accelerating for the third consecutive quarter. Geographically, we set all-time records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific, and solid Greater China returned to growth. Our record performance was fueled by iPhone where December quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone, including a new all-time record for Services and another blowout quarter for Wearables.
Our active installed base of devices has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 100 million in the last 12 months alone reaching a new all-time high for each of our main product categories and geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base of powerful testament to the satisfaction engagement and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our growth across the board, particularly in Services.
Let's take each category one by one. On iPhone, revenue in the December quarter was $56 billion. Again, that's up 8% over year ago. Thanks to the exceptional demand for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. In fact, iPhone 11 was our top selling model every week during the December quarter, and the three new models were our three most popular iPhones. We had double-digit growth in many developed markets, including the US, the UK, France and Singapore and also grew double-digits in emerging markets, led by strong performances in Brazil, Mainland China, India, Thailand and Turkey. These new models are by far the best iPhone's we've ever shipped with advanced technologies and unprecedented leap in battery life to easily get through the day and our best-in-class camera experience. We have been wild with the photos customers have shared in our all-new Night Mode photo challenge this month.
Turning to Services. Q1 revenue reached $12.7 billion, an all-time record growing 17% over last year. Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all five of our geographic segments and established new all-time records for multiple categories, including cloud services, music, payment services and our App Store search ad business, as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and Apple Care. 2019 was a historic year for our Services business. And I'd like to draw some highlights. For the App Store, 2020 started off strong with customers spending a new single day record $386 million on New Year's Day alone, a 20% increase over last year. Apple Arcade, our new game subscription service, has been fast off the blocks with a catalog of over 100 new and exclusive games you won't find anywhere else, all playable across Apple devices with new games and expansions added every month.
Apple TV+ is off to a rousing start, and I want to congratulate the entire team at The Morning Show for their multiple Golden Globe nominations, Jennifer Aniston on her Screen Actors Guild Award and Billy Crudup on his Critics' Choice Award. We continue to focus on telling stories that matter like Little America, which recently premiered to widespread critical acclaim with much more great content still to come.
Apple News now draws over 100 million monthly active users in the US, UK, Australia and Canada and provides a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories. Apple News+ continues to add new titles offering subscribers seamless access to the world's top publications across all of their devices.
For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with a run-rate exceeding 15 billion transactions a year. Apple Pay transit support expanded with customers paying for journeys on Transport for London more easily with Apple Pay Express Transit. And in spring of 2020, iPhone and Apple Watch customers will be able to simply tap to ride trains and buses and even more cities, including Shenzhen and Guangzhou. We are thrilled with the continued growth of Apple Card. And last month, customers began using Apple Card monthly installments at Apple retail and online to purchase new iPhones and pay for them over 24 months. We see great promise for these recently launched services, and we are optimistic about what we've got in the pipeline for each of them.
Now turning to Wearables. We had another incredible quarter setting an all-time record in virtually every market we track around the world and this product category is now the size of a Fortune 150 company. Demand for AirPods continues to be phenomenal, particularly for our recently launched AirPods Pro, our new addition to the AirPods family that features active noise cancellation. Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter. It continues to have a profound impact on our customers' lives and it continues to further its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to Apple Watch. Both AirPods and Apple Watch were must have holiday gifts helping drive unprecedented results for the category even as we face supply constraints for Apple Watch Series 3 and AirPods Pro.
Mac and iPad generated $7.2 billion and $6 billion in revenue, respectively. And the high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty for both products drove the active installed base of both Mac and iPad to new records in all geographic segments. For iPad, we saw growth in key emerging markets like Mexico, India, Turkey, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines and Vietnam. With our current lineup of iPad Pro, iPad Air iPad mini and iPad, along with the new iPad OS, we give our customers an unparalleled tablet experience integrated -- integrating hardware, software and services in a way that only Apple can.
This was also a very exciting quarter for the Mac as we launched our most powerful notebook ever. The 16-inch MacBook Pro as well as Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR, the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in the hands of pros. And we've already seen a strong response from the pro community from developers, photographers and music producers to filmmakers and scientists who rely on the Mac to create their life's best work. We also want to take a moment to congratulate all the Grammy-winning and nominated artists this past weekend, who rely on Logic Pro X and the Mac to create incredible music we all love.
I want to call out and celebrate the exceptional work of our retail and online teams. This quarter, we opened a beautiful new store in Kawasaki, Japan, and exciting things are taking place inside each and every store. Thanks in part to a doubling in iPhone trade-ins versus last year, our retail and online stores set an all-time record and delivered strong double-digit growth in iPhone. We see a very bright future for those -- for these efforts, and we continue to innovate to ensure that everyone who visits an Apple retail location has a great experience.
We began 2020 with our greatest product lineup ever, and we are only deepening our commitment to do our part to make the world a better place. In November, we released a completely redesigned Everyone Can Code curriculum to help introduce more elementary and middle school students to the world of coding. The new curriculum includes even more resources for teachers, a brand new guide for students and updated Swift Coding Club materials. Today, millions of students in more than 5,000 schools worldwide use Everyone Can Code curriculum to bring their ideas to life and develop important skills, including creativity, collaboration and problem solving.
November also saw the launch of our new Research app, the latest in our ongoing effort to put the future of health in the hands of every user. Customers in the US can enroll in three landmark multiyear health studies that we're undertaking with leading academic and research institutions, the Apple Women's Health Study, the Apple Heart and Movement Study and the Apple Hearing Study. As in everything we do, we've built user privacy into the Research app from the ground-up.
This quarter, we also announced a $2.5 billion plan to help address the housing availability and affording crisis in our home state of California. We feel a great responsibility to help the region we have always called home, stay vibrant and to ensure that it remains a great place for everyone to live and raise a family, including those who do so much to serve the community like firefighters and teachers. In much more recent news, we are closely following the development of the coronavirus. We are donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We are working closely with our Apple team members and partners in the affected areas, and our thoughts are with all of those affected across the region.
As we close the books on a record-breaking December quarter, we are already well under way on some new and exciting developments for the future. Apple strength will always be its boundless creativity and innovation, and this year will be no different.
But for now for more details on the results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. Revenue for the quarter was $91.8 billion, up $7.5 billion or 9% from a year ago in spite of a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange. Geographically, we established all-time revenue records in many major developed and emerging markets, including among others, the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone return to growth, and we have incredibly strong results in Wearables where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record $12.7 billion, with double-digit growth in every geographic segment, a new all-time record across our portfolio.
Company gross margin was 38.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue in spite of a negative 60 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 34.2% up 260 basis points sequentially. Thanks to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix.
Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%. Before discrete items, the rate was 16.5%, exactly in line with our guidance. A favorable one-time item impacted the rate by 230 basis points. Net income was an all-time record at $22.2 billion, up $2.3 billion or 11% over last year. Diluted EPS was also an all-time record at $4.99, up 19%, and operating cash flow was a very strong $30.5 billion, an improvement of $3.8 billion over a year ago.
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of $56 billion grew 8% year-over-year as we saw a great customer response to the launch of our newest iPhones. We set all-time revenue records in several countries, including the US, Mexico, the UK, France, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high and is growing in each of our geographic segments. In the US, the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Among business buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 84% plan to purchase iPhones.
Turning to services. We set an all-time revenue record of $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in all of our five geographic segments. As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and December quarter records for the App Store and Apple Care. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year '16 Services revenue during 2020. We've actually already reached that goal on a run rate basis with the results of the December quarter.
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double-digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 120 million from a year ago. And at this point, we expect to hit our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark already during the March quarter. Given the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across our services offerings, we are increasing our target for paid subscriptions and aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020.
App Store revenue grew strong double-digits. Thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year-over-year. Our first-party subscription services also continue to perform extremely well. Apple Music set an all-time revenue record offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers. iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record growing very strong double-digits, while offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices. It was a December quarter record for Apple Care. Thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution. Many of our partners have come to appreciate the strength of the Apple Care brand and our ability to deliver the very best service and support in the world. That value resonates with both our partners and our customers, and we're very happy to see that quality of experience delivered to more and more of our users.
Next, I'd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion, and iPad revenue was $6 billion. Both products had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the launches of MacBook Air, Mac mini and iPad Pro during the December quarter a year ago and the subsequent channel fill. Despite the tough compare on a demand basis, our performance for both Mac and iPad was around even to last year. Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product. And the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. The most recent -- the recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 92% from businesses. And among both consumers and businesses were planning to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPads.
Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37% year-over-year with very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments and growth across wearables, accessories and home. We set all-time records for wearables in virtually every market we track, even as we experienced some product shortages due to very strong customer demand for both Apple Watch and AirPod during the quarter.
We also continue to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise market as our technology solutions enable businesses to do their best work. 100% of Fortune 500 companies in the healthcare sector use Apple technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications and nursing workflows, and we're also seeing smaller companies in this sector drive innovation with our technology and apps. One example is Gauss Surgical, which uses CoreML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss during childbirth and surgery. This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information on whether a patient needs an intervention, which can impact both clinical outcomes and cost. Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company which makes a handheld ultrasound device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take ultrasound anywhere at a cost that is dramatically lower than other solutions in the market today.
Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $207 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued a EUR2 billion denominated green bond, retired $1 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper by $1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $99 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. We began a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30.4 million shares. We also repurchased 40 million Apple shares for $10 billion through open market transactions. And we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we have done for the last several years, we would share our plans for the next phase of our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter.
Finally, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63 billion and $67 billion. The wider-than-usual revenue range comprehends uncertainty related to the recently unfolding public health situation in China. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. We expect opex to be between $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2020 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2020.
With that, let's open the call to questions.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?
Questions and Answers:
Operator
Yes. That will be from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess first one for me on Wearables, fairly impressive to see it's already a $10 billion business for you guys. Can you just touch on the growth that you see on the Wearables side? How much of the growth you think is coming from first-time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have because it looks to us adoption rates are fairly low in your installed base, so that there should be a long runway, but love to just understand how you see the growth divide up between those two buckets?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Amit, it's Tim. If you look at the Apple or the wearables as a category within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, wearables grew 44%. So it was very strong, as you say. The -- both Apple Watch and AirPods did very well in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch in particular, 75% of the customers are new to the Apple Watch. And so, it's still very much a selling to new customers at this point.
Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Perfect. And I guess, Luca, if you could just touch on gross margins, the March quarter guide I think implied gross margins of flat to actually up 10 basis points, 15 basis points. It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March, I think, because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening. So what are the offsets that's enabling, what looks like a better-than-seasonal guide for gross margins?
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yes, that's right, Amit. It's about flat sequentially. And by the way, significantly higher on a year-over-year basis, but on a sequential basis, you're right on one side, we've got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality. But we expect that, that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please?
Operator
That will come from Tom Forte with DA Davidson.
Tom Forte -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst
Great, thank you for taking my question. So congrats on the launch of Apple TV+. I wanted to know internally how you're engaging success? Is it purely on critical acclaim? Is it on a number of consumers that are using the service, contribution of service revenue, etc., etc.? Thank you.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Hi Tom, it's Tim. We are primarily measuring ourselves on the number of subscribers. As you can tell from the way that we launched the product, we started with a very aggressive price at $4.99 and in addition to that, we have our bundle where if you buy pretty much any device, you're getting a year for free. And so, we're very focused on subscribers. That said, our -- the product itself is about storytelling, and we think if we do that well, then you will find that there will be some number of those it will also be critically acclaimed, and we're seeing that with The Morning Show. We're seeing that with Little America and others.
Tom Forte -- D.A. Davidson -- Analyst
Great. And then my second question is, I think you indicated that last month, you started offering consumers the ability to use a Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis. Can you talk about how that's had an impact on your unit sales for iPhones?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
So retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double-digit growth in iPhone from a year-over-year point of view. And one of the factors that enabled that was the getting to a monthly payment on the Apple Card to make it very simple. Of course, that's US-only at this point, but the US is a very key market for us. And so, it was an important part of it.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thank you, Tom. Can we have the next question please?
Operator
That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.
Shannon Cross -- Cross Research -- Analyst
Thank you very much. I wonder if you go back to revisit China. Tim, can you talk about what you're seeing in the region -- what you were seeing in the region prior to the health crisis. And then, can you also update us a bit in terms of your manufacturing strategy, dual sourcing, geographic diversification even within the region, just so we have some ideas of how this will be managed? Thank you.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Shannon. In terms of China, the results from last quarter and then I'll get into the coronavirus second. For the results from last quarter, we had double-digit growth for iPhone in Mainland China. So that was an important change from where we had been running. We also had double-digit growth in services in Mainland China, and we had extremely strong double-digit on wearables. And so, really there were a number of different factors. In terms of the things that customers are responding to, iPhone 11 is doing particularly well there. The product has been very well received with its battery life and the camera is unbelievable. We also, as you probably know, have certain trade-in programs going and financing programs. These have also been well received.
And so, it's sort of the sum of all of this and we are attracting quite the -- quite a large percentage of new customers on products like the Mac --three quarters of the customers buying a Mac in China are new and nearly two-thirds of the customers buying iPad are new. And so, it was a terrific quarter. We had three of the Top 4 selling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar.
In terms of the coronavirus. As I had mentioned earlier, first and foremost, our thoughts with all of those that are affected across the region and as I had mentioned, we're donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We're also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week. The situation is emerging, and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely. As Luca had mentioned, we have a wider-than-usual revenue range for the second quarter due to the greater uncertainty.
I'll talk about supply chain and customer demand some -- to give you some color. With respect to the supply chain, we do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. All of these suppliers, they are our alternate sources. And we're obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss. We factored best thinking in the guidance that we provided you. With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time. The reopening of those factories after Chinese New Year has been moved from the end of this month to February, 10 depending upon the supplier location, and we've attempted to account for this delayed start-up through our larger range of outcomes that, that Luca mentioned earlier.
With respect to customer demand and sales, we've currently closed one of our retail stores and a number of channel partners have also closed their storefronts. Many of the stores that remain open have also reduced operating hours. We're taking additional precautions and frequently deep cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees. While our sales within the Wuhan area itself are small, retail traffic has also been impacted outside of this area across the country in the last few days. And again, we have attempted to account for this in our guidance range that we've provided you. I hope that gets you some color.
Shannon Cross -- Cross Research -- Analyst
Yeah, that was very helpful. Luca, maybe if you could just touch on, from a gross margin perspective, the commodity pricing environment and availability, obviously there's been some movement on DRAM and NAND. So if you can talk about how you're thinking about inventory levels and managing that going forward. Thank you.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yes, as I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment. Most commodities have been declining during the December quarter, and we expect the same to happen in the March quarter. As always and as you probably know, we look at the way these prices move and at times when we feel it's appropriate, we buy certain commodities in advance. And so, we will continue that practice as we go through the year.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please?
Operator
That will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Thank you. Good afternoon. Luca, can you address the modest slowdown in services growth this quarter, 17% versus 18% in September? Which services categories accelerated versus where did you see some deceleration in the growth?
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Katy, let me make a couple of comments here. 17% during the December quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year '19 growth rate, which was 16%. So we feel very good about the results for the December quarter. As Tim and I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it was a very broad-based growth because we grew double-digits in services across all the five geographies. We set all-time records for many, many categories, music, cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store and Apple Care.
If you remember, we had set two goals for ourselves in the Services segment. First, we set a goal to double our fiscal '16 revenue during 2020, and when we look at it on a run rate basis, we've already achieved that goal with the results for the December quarter. We also set a goal to pass 500 million paid subscriptions during 2020 and given that we are already at 480 million at the end of December, we expect to pass that mark during the March quarter. And so, now we are setting a new target for ourselves for paid subscriptions. And so, we are now aiming to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. So we feel that the services business is growing incredibly well. Of course, we have launched new services very recently for example, Apple TV+ just launched in November. And so while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time these are contributing to the growth of the Services business, but we feel very happy with the 17%.
Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Thank you for that. Tim, as a follow-up, at some point in the future, Apple will launch a 5G iPhone, how big of a demand driver do you view 5G capability in a handset? And what's your view as to what the killer app will be from a consumer perspective?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
We don't comment on future products. And so, I'll try to sidestep a bit. With respect to 5G, I think it's -- we're in the early innings of its deployment on a global basis. We obviously couldn't be prouder of our lineup and is -- and are very excited about our pipeline as well and wouldn't trade our position for anybody.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question please?
Operator
We'll hear from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.
Kyle McNealy -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Hi, thanks a lot. So we're seeing some signs of new spectrum being deployed for 5G deployments and even additional 4G capacity, and it's already having a positive impact for handset upgrades to use that new capacity. Do you get the sense that wireless carriers are getting more incentivized to upgrade handsets to get leverage out of these new network investments? How much might this be helping and do you think it will continue to accelerate?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I think that we've had some great partners, not only in the US, but also around the world that was really helpful this quarter as partners. And so, I think probably a part of that is the level of investments they have and then a part of it is probably making sure that those customers stick with them in an environment where there's a lot of trading back and forth. So I'm optimistic that it will continue.
Kyle McNealy -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Okay, great. And then the comment that you made about capacity in your Wearables division with AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 3, what should we think about the timeline of when there is capacity constraints might be alleviated and will they come from capacity additions or the natural work out of kind of unit shipments and something on the demand side?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I'm hopeful that the Series 3 will come into balance during this quarter on AirPods Pro. I don't have an estimate for that for you. I just can't predict when at this point. We seem to be fairly substantially off there, and we're working very hard to put in additional capacity.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thanks, Kyle. Can we have the next question please?
Operator
Yes, Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Tim, Apple has a very valuable installed base of users. Can you see a future where Apple can become larger in the advertising market as you build out TV+ given you could have the unique position and ability to drive targeted ads to users without compromising on privacy?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I think it's -- I think it is possible to have advertising in a straightforward manner that doesn't encroach on people's privacy. I wouldn't want to conjecture about us in that business. I think for the TV+ business, we feel strongly that what that customer wants is an ad free product. And so, that's not our aversion to ads. It's what we believe that the customer wants.
Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America -- Analyst
Okay, thank you. And Luca, can you just clarify if the Services revenue this quarter had any impact of deferrals associated with TV+ at all and how can you help us maybe size the impact of the amortization of the content cost associated with TV+ as we think about the next couple of years? Thank you.
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So yes, of course, we launched the service. And so, there was a very small contribution to revenue from the deferral, and there was also contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually paying for the service. When you think about what goes into the Apple TV+ revenue at this point, there are two components, the paid subscribers. These are customers that pay for the service. And we recognize revenue over the subscription period. And then, we've got the, what we call, the Apple TV+ bundle subscribers. These are the customers that buy an eligible hardware device and redeem the offer for a three-year of TV+ services. We defer revenue for this offer based on three items. The first one is the value of the service that is being provided, the one year of Apple TV+. The second one is the number of customers that are eligible for the offer. And the third one is our estimate of the expected number of customers that we redeem the offer.
So you need to keep in mind that from our total eligible device sales, you need to make a number of reductions for family sharing, for multiple device purchases and for geographic availability. Also the take rates can also be impacted by the availability of local content, and we also require a payment method on file. So this estimate is reviewed quarterly and gets updated based on actual trends of the offer. And so, these inputs provide us with the amount of revenue that we defer for each device sale that then gets recognized over the one year period that the TV+ service is provided. And so, when you take the combination of paid subscribers and bundled subscribers, you get the Apple TV+ revenue, of course because we launched the service very recently. The amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter was immaterial to our results.
With regard to the cost of the service, of developing the content, we -- essentially, as we incur this cost, we put them on the balance sheet and then we amortize them over a certain period of time depending on the type of content that we produce.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have the next question please?
Operator
We'll hear from Cowen and Company's Krish Sankar.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the great results. I have two questions. First one, Tim, I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on the overall smartphone market. There is a general view that when 5G phones come out, they're going to be more expensive due to higher component costs. But at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low- cost geographies with phones like iPhone SE. So how do you see these two different segments within the smartphone market evolving over the next one to three years? And then I had a follow-up for Luca.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
Again, I want to stay away from commenting about future products. But generally, I think it's important when you think about 5G is to look around the world at the different deployment schedules. And some of those look very different perhaps than what you might be seeing here. And so, that's very important. In terms of the price, I wouldn't want to comment on the price of handsets that aren't announced.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Got it. No worries, Tim. And then I have a follow-up to Luca. Opex as a percentage of sales for March looks like about 15% higher than in your prior quarters. Kind of curious how much of that is part of it is driven by some of your Intel modem asset purchases or TV+ in the opex or how do we think about it on a go-forward basis?
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think we felt good about our opex results because they were at the low end of our guidance range, but clearly, we want to make all the necessary investments in the business and from -- in terms of the new services, not only for TV+, but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is a period where we're making the necessary investments in advertising and marketing and that level of investment is reflected in our opex results. And also as you correctly stated, we completed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business during the December quarter. And so, we had -- we reflected the run rate of the expenses related to that business partially during the quarter after the completion of the transaction. And we -- that is a very important core technology for the Company. So we will continue to make all the necessary investments also there. There is a third category of expenses that affected the December quarter and is the fact that our revenue was very strong. And we have certain variable expenses, for example, credit card fees that are associated with the higher volume and of course, impacted our opex results.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thanks, Krish. Can we have the next question please?
Operator
That will be from Mike Olson with Piper Sandler.
Mike Olson -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So slightly different take on an earlier question on Wearables and that is -- what impact do you think Wearables is having on driving people into the Apple ecosystem? You mentioned 75% of watch buyers are new to the Apple Watch, but many of them new to Apple overall. I'm sure a lot of existing iPhone, iPads or Mac users are going to be Wearables customers, but do you think Wearables bring people into the ecosystem to buy other devices in a material way?
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I think that -- Michael, it's Tim. With each Apple product that a customer buys, I think they get tighter into the ecosystem, because they like -- that's the reason that they're buying into it is they like the experience -- the customer experience. And so, from that point of view, I think each of our products can drive another product. I would think in that case, it's more likely that the iPhone comes first. But there is no doubt in my mind that there is some people that came into the ecosystem for the Watch.
Mike Olson -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Okay. And then I think you recently mentioned that augmented reality will pervade our entire lives. And I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts about how you think it starts to impact our lives more significantly? For example, will the inflection point in AR come from gaming or industrial usage or some other category. In other words, where will the average person, kind of, first feel the impact of AR on their lives in a significant way? Thanks.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
I think when you look at AR today, you would see that there are consumer applications, there are enterprise applications. This is the reason I'm so excited about it is you rarely have a new technology where business and consumer are both see it as key to them. And so, I think it's -- the answer is, that's the reason that I think it's going to pervade your like is, because it's going to go across both business and your whole life. And I think these things will happen in parallel. There are already companies that are deep into the enterprise business that are working on applications for the enterprise and of course, you can see -- you can go on the store and see thousands of apps that are AR Kit-enabled at this time and with even more coming.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?
Operator
That will come from Raymond James, Chris Caso.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess the first question is on gross margins and you spoke about the favorable mix. Wondering if you could expand on that a little bit and clearly, iPhone is doing well within the overall mix that growing year-on-year. But if you could talk about what's happening to the mix within iPhone, is that improving as well and also helping margins and is there anything else you would point to with regard to the overall mix in margins?
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yes, I think that the mix helped us both in Q1 and it's helping us with the guidance for Q2. And as you said, some of it is mix of iPhones. The customer response for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max has been exceptional and that clearly has helped our mix. iPhone 11 was our top-selling model throughout the quarter, every single week of the quarter. And so, certainly better mix within iPhone. The other point that I would like to point out is that as we move from Q1 to Q2, the proportion of revenue coming from Services increases versus the holiday quarter. And given the fact that Services are accretive to gross margin for the Company, we end up getting a better mix from Services as well.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Okay, thank you. And I guess, follow-on question with regard to opex and it has been growing at a faster rate than revenue for, I guess, largely over the last three years or so, can you set us some expectation with regard to when you get a return on that investment? I understand there are new investments that are happening now. But how should we think about potential leverage going forward? Is there a point in time where the opex spending tends to level off and you get some return on that or is it just a function of faster revenue growth in the future?
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Well, I would start by saying that our expense-to-revenue ratio is incredibly competitive relative to other companies in our sector. There are years when our opex grows faster than our revenue. But we've also had years in the recent past, where the opposite has happened. We continue to believe that we have a lot of great opportunities in front of us. And just if you look at this past year, we launched many new initiatives for example on the Services front, which we want to support with the appropriate level of investment, not only marketing and advertising, but also in R&D. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business because we think it's a very important strategic core technology for the Company going forward.
And I think from the results that you've seen during this quarter and the guidance that we provided during -- for the March quarter, I think we're doing a pretty good job at balancing the level of investments that we are making on the expense front with the level of returns that we get more in terms of revenue and in terms of profitability that we're getting. Our net income, for example, was up 11% during the December quarter.
Tejas Gala -- Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations
Thank you. Can we have the next question please?
Operator
That will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.
Samik Chatterjee -- JP Morgan -- Analyst
Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to kind of ask on the iPhone revenue growth. Definitely good to see a return to growth based on the velocity or momentum you're seeing for the products exiting the quarter, how comfortable are you feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone revenues through the year? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook -- Chief Executive Officer
We have a practice of forecasting the current quarter. And so, we've given you the range that we expect that the current quarter and really don't give a range beyond that.
Samik Chatterjee -- JP Morgan -- Analyst
Okay. So if you can just maybe then follow-up in terms of -- obviously, you've returned to growth in most of the regions. You report one of the reasons that are declining is Japan. So if you can share your thoughts on what actions you need to take there to return that segment -- that geography to growth and what are the product trends there? What's probably the headwind that's kind of limiting growth there?
Luca Maestri -- Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, Japan was down 10% during the December quarter. It was primarily due to iPhone performance, which was challenge because there were some regulatory changes that took effect on October 1 where essentially the regulators decoupled the mobile phone pricing from the two-year contracts and are capping the maximum amount of carrier discounts that can be made. At the same time, I would say within a more difficult macro environment, iPhone did incredibly well during the quarter. Six of the Top 7 selling smartphone models in Japan during the December quarter were iPhones. So it was a very strong performance by iPhone in a difficult environment. Also in June, we had a very strong double-digit growth from Services, stronger than Company average and very strong double-digit growth in Wearables, also stronger than Company average. So we feel very good. Japan is a country where historically we've had great success. The customers are very loyal and very engaged, and we have very strong position there. And we feel we have a very good momentum.

All earnings call transcripts","In the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020, Apple Inc. reported its largest quarter ever, setting new all-time records in terms of both revenue and earnings, surpassing expectations with revenue totalling $91.8 billion. The impressive performance was largely driven by the iPhone, experiencing an 8% year-over-year revenue increase, and by continued double-digit growth in sectors outside the iPhone.  

Specifically, iPhone revenue hit $56 billion, attributed to robust demand for iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max models. In services, Q1 revenue reached an all-time high of $12.7 billion, with double-digit growth across all geographical segments. Also, Apple Pay transactions more than doubled year-over-year, indicating widespread adoption and the success of recent initiatives like the Apple Card. 
  
The wearables sector also reported exceptional growth, marking an all-time high in revenue and reflecting strong customer demand. Meanwhile, Mac and iPad generated revenues of $7.2 billion and $6 billion, respectively. 
 
Apple’s CFO, Luca Maestri, highlighted the company's financial health, with a recorded all-time high in net income at $22.2 billion and diluted earnings per share at $4.99. The company's gross margin improved, and its operational cash flow stood strong at $30.5 billion. Maestri also discussed the ongoing success of Apple's services, which have now reached over 480 million paid subscriptions, moving towards a target of 600 million by the end of 2020. 
  
For the upcoming quarter, Apple provided a revenue forecast with a wider range than usual, between $63 billion and $67 billion. The gross margin expectation is set between 38% and 39%, with operational expenses predicted to be between $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion."
ICFI,"Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 ICF Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, November 2, 2021, and cannot be reproduced or rebroadcast without permission from the company. And now I would like to turn the program over to Lynn Morgan of Advisory Partners.
Lynn Morgen -- Investor Relations
Thank you, Vanessa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review ICF's third quarter 2021 performance. With us today from ICF are John Wasson, President and CEO and Bettina Welsh, CFO. Joining them is James Morgan, Chief of Business Operations. During this conference call, we will make forward looking statements to assist you in understanding ICF management's expectations for our future performance. These statements are subject to a number of risks that could cause actual events and results to differ materially and I refer you to our November 2, 2021, press release and our SEC filings for discussions of those risks. In addition, our statements during this call are based on our views as of today. We anticipate that future developments will cause our views to change. Please consider the information presented in that light. We may, at some point, elect to update the forward-looking statements made today, but specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. I will now turn the call over to ICF's CEO, John Wasson, to discuss third quarter 2021 performance. John?
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Lynn, and thank you all for participating in our call today to review our third quarter and year to date performance and discuss our business outlook. By all measures, this was another strong quarter for ICF, demonstrating the positive momentum in our business that we have experienced throughout this year and pointing to the substantial growth opportunities on the horizon as we head into 2022.. Key takeaways that I would like to highlight include: the continued revenue growth from government and commercial energy clients, which together accounted for 88% of year-to-date revenues to 7.1% year to date increase in service revenue, of which over 60% represented work in the key growth areas that we identified two years ago and where we believe the opportunities are even more robust given the current administration's priorities. Our efficient execution on existing contracts, which in tandem with higher utilization, and other positive factors drove the exceptional expansion of our adjusted EBITDA to service revenue margin. While this margin level is not sustainable due to higher anticipated costs in future periods, we expect our business model to be able to continue to drive considerable operating leverage. And our success in retention and new business capture, which resulted in a book to bill of 1.5 times in Q3 and 1.33 times for the trailing 12 months. These metrics, along with our record new business development pipeline of $7.3 billion, underscore how well aligned, ICF's subject matter expertise and cross cutting implementation skills are with market demand. Looking more closely at our performance by client category, third quarter federal government revenues increased 11.4% year on year led by our continued work in IT modernization, digital transformation, public health and social programs, climate change and resilience.
We continue to execute well on our IT modernization and digital transformation contracts, with Unite Aid service revenue growth in this area of 17%, and our pipeline of new opportunities has never been higher, reaching $1.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. This has also been a strong year for us in public health contract awards. In the third quarter alone, ICF was awarded over $75 million in recompete contracts by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to support the nationwide surveillance platform, BioScience as well as to provide an array of digital transformation, health surveillance program management and communication services to several agencies, divisions and offices to support HIV prevention, smoking cessation, cancer prevention and genetic rare disease research. Additionally, we were awarded $15 million in contracts tied to COVID-19 response bringing the cumulative total value of our pandemic related contract wins to over $70 million. Today, we announced the acquisition of a small but uniquely specialized firm that further strengthens ICF position in the public health arena. ESAC brings advanced health analytics and bioinformatics capabilities to ICF along with how they credentialed 40 person staff that serves Arosa government and academic clients as well as federally funded research centers and private organizations. We look forward to working together with the ESAC team to gain revenue synergies by expanding ICF services at existing federal clients and leveraging their contract relationships with clients such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Veteran Administration. On a related note, you will see our earnings release that we called out an after tax third quarter expense of $0.12 per share related to M&A costs.
This was in connection with a highly competitive transaction that we pursued, but ultimately passed on late in the process as pricing moved above our comfort zone based on anticipated revenue synergies. Revenues from state and local government clients increased 15% in the third quarter, reflecting growth in our disaster management and environmental consulting work. We continue to extend and expand our work in Puerto Rico in the third quarter, occupying a central role in FEMA project formulation and grants management. And we won a new award for $22.1 million for the Citi revitalization program under the Puerto Rico Department of Housing. In addition, in early October, the Puerto Rico Disaster Recovery transparency portal noted that ICF was awarded a 33-month $89 million contract for follow-on FEMA grant management support. ICF has a rigorous process for announcing new contract wins, but we wanted to make sure you're aware of this notification. The mitigation market continues to develop as U.S. communities continue to suffer from the increasing evidence of severe weather related events. In the third quarter, FEMA released a notice of funding opportunity for the 2021 Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, known as Brick at double the funding levels of 2020.
In addition, more than half the opportunities in the HUD funded community development block grant mitigation appropriations funded by Congress in 2018 remain to be awarded. Just yesterday, HUD announced the allocation of more than $2 billion in CDBG disaster recovery and mitigation funding for 15 separate disasters that occurred across 10 states in 2020. And we expect to Biden the administration to continue to add to mitigation programs in the future. With climate resilience and branch management qualifications and our position as the largest provider in the CDBG mitigation program, ICF continues to be very competitive within the mitigation and resilience markets. Additionally, we continue to support our state and local government clients with environmental services, particularly in transportation, water, energy and planning and development. ICF was recently awarded a new $30 million environmental services contract for the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Authority's Link21 program to provide environmental services to support a major infrastructure expansion to its passenger rail network. ICF's Climate Environment & Transportation division also won a number of contracts in the third quarter, including multiple task orders with the City and County of Honolulu, the Texas Department of Transportation, the California Energy Commission, the Minnesota Metropolitan Council, New York City's Mayor's Office of Sustainability, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Government in Hawaii State Energy Office.
As noted in our earnings release, revenues from international government clients increased substantially in the third quarter, with approximately 1/3 of the 60% increase tied to a sizable short-term project with substantial pass through revenues that we expect to wind down by the end of Q1 2022. In terms of trends, we are seeing greater clarity from clients, particularly in the European Commission on new funding initiatives as the impact of COVID receives and continued demand for services related to climate and social inclusion. Moving to the commercial category. In Marketing Services, we continue to gain recognition for excellent client work and win new business. But overall activity levels remain below pre-pandemic levels. Turnover is an industry wide issue and year on year revenue comparisons reflect the completion of a large contract at the end of last year. That said, we continue to leverage the excellent engagement qualifications and expertise that are resident in our commercial marketing business across the ICF footprint, which is materializing and expanded work for government and commercial energy clients. And we continue to carefully manage this part of our commercial business, which represented about 9% of total year to date revenues. In the last two quarters, we have seen a discernible pickup in our aviation consulting business, while still a small part of our commercial revenues, our airline and airport clients are engaging ICF for sustainable aviation and tourism projects in Europe and for logistics projects in North America. Our energy market work remained the core of ICF's commercial client category. Year-to-date, revenues increased 8.7%, representing solid growth across our energy efficiency, Energy Markets Advisory and domestic Environmental Services businesses.
With contract awards from utility clients, including traditional energy efficiency programs, electrification programs, distributed energy resources and customer analytics, we anticipate continued strong market demand. And while we are one of the largest players in this area, we believe there is opportunity to only grow within the market, but to also increase our market share. In addition to California, we continue to monitor developments in several other states as energy efficiency related programs are instituted or expanded to address state climate targets. For example, in New York, ICF implemented a clean heat program for all the New York Investor old Utilities. This innovative program is designed to replace fossil fuel heating systems with electric heat pumps. We expect similar electrification programs, including expansion of electric vehicle programs and several other jurisdictions. Also, our energy markets advisory business have seen continued high demand for ICF's financial and engineering due diligence services around the deployment and development of renewable resources and energy storage. Our Environmental Services business has also been active on energy project development opportunities as we won an additional contract for an East Coast offshore wind project, a construction compliance project for solar development in Arizona, an environmental impact assessment for a wind project to Wyoming and numerous smaller engagements with renewable developers and utilities. This gives you a good sense of the breadth of our commercial energy portfolio of services, which we see as having substantial run rate for growth in the coming years. In summary, the third quarter marked another period of significant growth for ICF following the very positive comparisons we achieved in the first half of this year. This performance has set the stage for excellent 2021. And together with our strong backlog and robust business development pipeline underscores ICF significant growth prospects for 2022 and beyond. And they do remain additional catalysts in the near term associated with infrastructure and stimulus legislation and 2022 civilian fiscal priorities that could further expand our growth opportunities for the next year and beyond. Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Bettina Welsh, for a financial review. Bettina?
Bettina Garcia Welsh -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everyone. Our total revenue increased 9.4% to $394.1 million year on year, led by a 16.1% increase in revenue from government clients and a 3% increase in revenue from commercial energy clients, which reflected the pull forward of energy efficiency program revenues in the first half of this year. Year to date revenue from commercial energy clients increased 8.7%, which is consistent with the positive business trends in this client category. Third quarter pass through revenue increased to 30.1% of total revenue from 26.5% in the year ago quarter, primarily due to higher activity on our USAID project work. For the first nine months of 2021, a pass-throughs accounted for 28.2% of total revenue, in line with our expectations for the full year. This takes into account the significant reduction in pass through revenue that we highlighted for this year's fourth quarter, resulting from the completion of a large commercial marketing contracts. Service revenue grew 4.1% year over year to $275.6 million and was up 7.1% year to date. Gross profit increased 2.1% year on year to $139.9 million. Gross margin on total revenue was 35.5%, lower year to year due to increased pass throughs. On service revenue, gross margin was 50.8%, which was 100 basis points lower year to year due to timing of fee recognition on energy-related contracts. Indirect and selling expenses were $99.9 million, similar to the $100.1 million in the third quarter of 2020. As the percentage of service revenue, indirect and selling expenses declined to 36.3%, 150 basis points below last year's third quarter, with the majority due to lower facilities and related costs. Third quarter EBITDA was up 8.2% to $39.9 million and adjusted EBITDA, which excludes special charges, was up 16.1% to $43.8 million.
Adjusted EBITDA margin on service revenue expanded 160 basis points to 15.9%, primarily reflecting higher utilization and the lower indirect and selling expenses as a percentage of revenue I just noted. Operating income of $32.3 million was up 14.2% from the $28.3 million reported in the third quarter of 2020. Our tax rate was 31.6% compared to 27.2% in the third quarter of 2020 due to return to provision adjustments resulting from increased revenue generated in higher tax jurisdictions. Net income for the quarter was $20.4 million or $1.07 per diluted share, up 14.1% and 13.8%, respectively, from the $17.9 million or $0.94 per diluted share reported in the third quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of amortization of intangibles, M&A expense and severance and staff realignment charges, earnings per share increased 19.5% to $1.32 year over year. Turning to cash flow. Our year to date operating cash flow was $64.8 million and supports our increased operating cash flow guidance of $110 million, up from $100 million.
Capital expenditures for the first nine months were $12.3 million compared to $12.9 million in the prior year. Days sales outstanding for the third quarter were 76 days compared to 83 days last year. In the third quarter, our net leverage ratio declined to 1.87, and we expect this to decline further to about 1.75 by the end of the year. Also, today, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14 per share payable on January 12, 2022, to shareholders of record on December 10, 2021. For modeling purposes, here are our expectations for the full year 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be in the range of $19 million to $20 million. Amortization of intangibles should be between $11.8 million and $12.2 million. Interest expense is now expected to range from $10 million to $11 million, and a full year tax rate will now be no greater than 29%. We expect fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately $19.1 million for 2021. And capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $20 million. ICF's capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, balanced between investing to drive organic growth and making strategic acquisitions as well as debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. With that, I'll turn the call back to John for his closing remarks.
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Bettina. As you've seen in today's earnings release, our year to date performance and expectations for good showing in Q4 have led us to increase our guidance range for full year 2021 GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS, which now represent year on year growth of 45% and 15%, respectively, at the midpoint. EBITDA is anticipated to be at the high end of the guidance range or slightly above. The guidance ranges for total revenue and service revenue remain the same. We expect fourth quarter service revenue to be comparable to third quarter levels with similar trends, namely that growth in the government and commercial energy client categories will more than offset lower commercial marketing revenues. Also, we are pleased to be raising our full year operating cash flow guidance to $110 million from $100 million. Over 60% of ICF's year to date service revenue represented work in key areas in which we expect growth rates in the aggregate to be at least 10% over the next several years. These include the high growth areas of IT modernization, public health, disaster management and utility consulting as well as climate, environment and infrastructure, which align well with the current administration's priorities. Additionally, we have the financial resources to pursue acquisitions that can further expand our addressable market.
Analysts and investors often hear me speak about ICF's culture as an important differentiator. Of course, we have not been immune from the staffing issues that have impacted others in our industry, in fact, most industries in the country. That said, we believe we are navigating better than most and have expanded our recruiting and retention activities in today's challenging business environment. We have nurtured a collaborative culture at ICF for the past 50 years. It has enabled us to attract an exceptional group of people dedicated to making a difference by bringing together subject matter expertise with a broad range of cross selling skills, that enable us to deliver positive results for our clients. We believe our culture has been a key factor in the company's success to date and will continue to drive our growth. Lastly, on January 19, 2022, we will host an Investor Day in New York City to provide you with greater insight into the growth drivers we see on the horizon for ICF and give you the opportunity to engage with our subject matter experts and those leading our cross cutting capabilities in technology and digital engagement. Invitations will be sent out shortly. Please direct any questions to Lynn Morgan. We do hope you can join us. With that, operator, I'd like to now open the call to questions.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question from Tobey Summer with Truist Securities.
Tobey Summer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
John, I was hoping you could maybe tell us about your acquisition appetite and intention, given what looks like what what must have been a pretty big swing for the company?
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think as we've talked about in the past, Tobey, I mean M&A has been a key component of our strategy for the company for 15 years. As we've talked about in that period, we've enjoyed 15% compound average growth rate. About half of that has been organic. That has been inorganic. And I think as we look forward, we certainly continue to believe that we can add value and drive growth in the company through M&A activities. I think we remain focused in the same markets. We've talked about quite a bit over the last couple of years in the federal market, so looking at IT modernization and federal health markets and then on the commercial side looking in the energy industry. And I think that's been our focus. And we'll continue to look for the companies that bring the deep domain expertise, implementation skills that we think we can really drive synergistic revenues. As we've talked many times, we don't do turnarounds. We don't do fixer uppers. We're looking looking to get quality companies where we can make one plus one equal three. And so I think the focus remains consistent with what we've talked about, and we're quite focused on trying to add scale and capability in these key growth markets where we can really drive significant synergistic value for shareholders.
Tobey Summer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
How would you describe the contract awards in the quarter with respect to sort of momentum established prior to the administration change versus processes and procurements that started after the baton was passed to the by administration?
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I think by and large, we're still winning awards that were in capture and bids submitted prior to the new administration. So the strong sales performance and the very strong book to bill results we've reported for the last four or five quarters, really, I think, are, do not reflect the potential upside from this administration. I think that I think we'll start to see, I would expect to see opportunities from the new administration to play a larger role as we go into Q4 and Q1 in terms of our pipeline and potential awards. And we start to win those and it could be material certainly as we get into the second half of next year. But by and large, to date, I would say that the awards and the book to bill and the sales you've seen predate the administration.
Tobey Summer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
Okay. Just one or two more for me. I'll try to make them quick. What percentage of your employees are now vaccinated? And how do you ballpark the percentage of employees that you may lose due to vaccine mandates? This is a problem that corporate America largely is tackling in especially in the services sector, of course.
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, of course. Yes. I think we're north of 95% of our employees are vaccinated. I mean we have stated that we imposed the vaccine requirement on our employees by, I think, the end of November. And so we're working through the last 5%. I think, the results are increasing daily. My sense is we'll get the vast majority of folks vaccinated. I don't think we're going to see material impacts from a vaccination policy and our business. I think to the extent we have issues, we'll be able to manage it. I don't expect any material issues there. I will note all the officers in the company are vaccine at this point. So certainly, the leadership is aligned on this issue, and I don't expect material impacts or material risk.
Tobey Summer -- Truist Securities -- Analyst
And last question for me, if I could just get your broad sense for, if inflation fixed stays elevated for a period of time, how does that impact your ability to grow and to achieve the margin goals that you would like?
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
I think that, I think as we've talked in the past, I think that ICF is fairly inflation resistant or proof. I mean, 65%, 70% of our work is in government markets that I don't think we'd see the impact from inflation. The energy industry, I mean, again, I think it's not a significant concern. So I think we believe the inflation we'll be able to manage it, we'll be able to deliver our margins. Obviously, we're seeing wage inflation and wage pressures like every company in America is, and we're watching that carefully, monitoring it carefully. We're certainly doing what we need to remain at market and retain and keep our people motivated. It is a challenging time. I do think on that front, we believe we'll be able to pass significant portion of those costs to our clients. As we've also talked about, we are having, we are achieving savings from the pandemic that we think will last for the long run, both in travel and entertainment and in facilities costs, which I think also provide a buffer to kind of manage pressures that we're feeling on the wage front. And so I guess that's a long winded way of saying, Tobey, that I think we feel we're in good shape and should be able to managing weather and inflationary environment and deliver the margins and further on expectations.
Operator
And we have our next question from Joseph Vafi with Canaccord.
Joseph Vafi -- Canaccord -- Analyst
Good results. I'm just wondering if we could drill down a little bit more into some of the mitigation comments that you made, John, both on FEMA and then on the HUD side of things. It sounds like perhaps that those budgets are, at least on the FEMA side, there could be incrementally bigger than you thought and then timing on any piece of business that could be put out to bid there. And then I'll have a follow-up.
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, sure. I certainly think that there's certainly more emphasis in FEMA on mitigation funding. And as you know, and I said in the remarks, the budgets are increasing there. They've also opened the lens of what they'll support to include climate-related activities. And so I think that is a market that we are seeing more funding. We will see more opportunities here in the next, as we go forward here and the next two, three, four quarters, and it's a core part of our business. So we certainly see the mitigation market as a growth market and the FEMA component of that market, a growth market. As you know, I mean, we're a leader on the CDBG side of the mitigation activities. As we've talked about in the past, we've won five or six mitigation contracts here in the last to two or three quarters, I think we probably want more opportunities or certainly one at the high end, we're one of the most awarded firms on the mitigation from CDBG mitigation front. And there's still, as I said in remarks, significant award decisions pending in that market given the appropriations from 2018. And as I said in my remarks, the additional $2 billion for 2020 that was just announced in the last day. So I think it is an area of continued growth for us. I think there will be more opportunity there. We expect awards in the near term on. Certainly, we've been discussing to Puerto Rico mitigation opportunities.
Those are moving along. We'd expect decisions here in the next quarter or two on those. And so we certainly view that as a growth market, Joe. And an increasing market or the trends are becoming more favorable. I know Tobey asked the question, well, what are the, as the administration had in fact, I think we're starting to see some of the initial impacts of this administration in terms of putting more money behind mitigation, which should lead to proposal activities here in the next quarter or two for us.
Joseph Vafi -- Canaccord -- Analyst
Got it. And then IT modernization has been doing really well to spend a very steady performance on new contract awards. Some of those, obviously, a little bit on the larger side, to, it looks like maybe this quarter was a little lighter. Is there anything building there in the pipeline, in the near term pipeline? And any kind of commentary on the quarterly bookings there? I know, obviously, sometimes things are lumpy up and down, and timing is really more factor than anything else.
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Sure. Yes. I mean I think, well, first of all, I'm quite pleased that the business grew 17% in the quarter. That was good to see. I mean we have a very robust pipeline in IT monetization, Joe. We, I think we, the pipeline is north of $1.5 billion, I think it said record high this quarter. The awards can be lumpy, but I think I'm confident that's going to remain a significant growth driver for us here as we look to the future and look to the long term. As I've said before, I think we're in the third or fourth inning here in the federal government of modernizing IT platforms, including civilian platforms. And so I think it's a positive long-term trend for us. So I remain, I think we remain very excited and very positive on that market.
Operator
Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.
Andrew Nicholas -- William Blair -- Analyst
This is actually Trevor Romeo for Andrew. First of all, I just kind of wanted to ask about the commercial marketing business. I think last quarter, revenue has kind of returned to being roughly flattish, and it declined a bit this quarter. So just curious kind of what caused the incremental weakness this quarter? And any more color on trends for that business and kind of your expected pace of rebound in the future would be really helpful.
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I think the, I think we, as you'll see in the release, I think the decline in our commercial revenues was entirely related to commercial marketing services. We did complete a contract in the second half of last year that is certainly impacting the comparisons this year. But beyond that, I would say that commercial marketing services certainly has not recovered in the way we had initially planned this year. I think we thought we'd see some improvement as we got into the second half of the year. We certainly have not seen that improvement. We are managing the business very carefully as we've talked about. It does represent, as I said, about 9% of our year to date revenues. And so I think we certainly, there's certain verticals in that in commercial marketing services that continue to be impacted by the pandemic and client budgets so tight and clients are being very careful with their spending, and we certainly saw some of that in the third quarter. And so I think that's what's going on in commercial marketing services.
Joseph Vafi -- Canaccord -- Analyst
Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just on margins. I know this kind of an estimate in prior quarters, particularly given the strong margin this quarter. Just wanted to see if your view has changed at all on sort of potential for expense savings or sort of the extent to which some of those delayed expenses could come back as we look forward to next year and beyond?
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
I would say that on the expense front, I think we're continuing to reap benefits from the impacts of the pandemic that the long run will not be, are not sustainable. But having said that, I think we have talked about the fact that in the long run, we believe that 25% of the travel entertainment spend pre-pandemic. We can, we will save as we go forward. I think we've taken steps to manage our facility footprint, and we we continue to look at our facility footprint as a way to reduce our expenses going forward. We think that could be material. Obviously, some of what you're seeing is we've, our offices are still closed. So our operating costs and our offices are down. Eventually, we will open up those offices again. And so I think there is some leverage there, but this quarter was quite unusual in on several fronts in terms of how we got to the market levels I do. I think we have historically talked about 10 to 20 bps of improvement in adjusted EBITDA to service revenue. Over time, I think there's potential that could go higher given some of the savings that were, that I've just mentioned. And certainly, we'll, we continue to take a hard look at that and I'm sure we'll have a discussion on that as we talk about guidance for next year.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Marc Riddick with Sidoti & Company.
Marc Riddick -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst
So a few of my questions have already been answered, but I did want to touch a little bit around the, if you could share some thoughts as to what you're seeing internationally both as far as activity levels as well as potential for adding expertise outside of the States. And then I have a quick follow-up after that.
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I would say in terms of the market, I mean, I think we've reported significant growth in our international markets for several quarters now. And I would say in the third quarter, we, as I said in my remarks, we are seeing some positive signs in the European commission market and early signs of activation of work. We have a contract to do communication support for the European Commission, where we've seen some recent activation of work. We're seeing a lot of interest in climate and decarbonization out of the European Commission. That's certainly an area where we're going to see growth as we go forward. And so we're, the European Commission with the pandemic we seating, we're certainly starting to see signs of activation of work and growth there, which we're quite pleased with. We've also had a project that we talked about that it's been a one year energy related project. They've had it will wind down early next year. But even setting that aside, I think we're generally pleased with the trends we're seeing in the European Commission and the opportunities there. On the M&A front, I would say that we're primarily focused, so we are focused here in North America right now on the M&A front. I think we really believe that given the key growth drivers we're talking about, the highest value could be, can be achieved with a focus on North America in the key growth markets, IT modernization, health and energy. And so Europe is really not, it's not a focus at least for the next year. But obviously, we're out in the market and talking to people and if we saw, and I'm sure we'll continue to evaluate opportunities there, but it's not an earlier focus right now on the M&A side.
Marc Riddick -- Sidoti & Company -- Analyst
Okay. Great. And then my follow-up is around potential headcount adds. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether or sort of how you're feeling about adding on whether it's on a junior level or certainly talent acquisition is sort of sort of pricing at this time, but I just want to sort of check in on sort of how you're feeling about sort of bearing on the base and getting us ambitions on that.
John M. Wasson -- Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I mean, obviously, we're a people driven business. And at the end of the day, if we're growing our revenues, we need to be adding people. We need to be adding headcount. And so we've been able to do that. I think we've, I will say we're investing we've materially increased our investment in recruiting in the last several quarters given the competitive nature of the job market. But with that, we've been able to hire the talent to support our growth. And I think we'll need to maintain and sustain those investments. But generally, we've been able to hire the people in a timely way. And you can see in the results, the growth we're driving.. I do think we will continue to invest in the recruiting. We are quite focused on, also on the retention side, once we have the people on board making sure we're how they engage with our workforce that we're, we really understand where the market is, and we're addressing any market issues, thinking hard about retention, and all the other things you need to do throughout this pandemic, wellness and making sure they balance their work and home life and those types of things. And so, but on the recruiting front, I think we've generally been able to, we're certainly adding headcount and have been able to find the people.

Operator
Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Nordson Corporation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2021. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over Lara Mahoney.
Lara Mahoney -- Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications
Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO and Joseph Kelly, Executive Vice President and CFO.
We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, May 25, 2021 to report Nordson's fiscal 2021 second quarter results. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www.nordson.com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our Investor website and will be available there for 14-day. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until Tuesday, June 1.
During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric was provided in the press release issued yesterday.
Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that could cause actual results to differ.
Moving to today's agenda on Slide 3. Naga will discuss second quarter highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the two business segments. Joe also will talk about the balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will conclude with high level commentary about our enterprise performance as well as our updated fiscal 2021 full year guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions.
With that, I'll turn to Slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2021 second quarter conference call. Throughout fiscal 2020, we remain invested in what makes Nordson strong our direct sales model and innovative position technology portfolio. We also advanced our new NBS Next growth framework, which ensures we focus our resources on the best opportunities for profitable growth. This strategy has positioned us well last year. And as the recovery continues to accelerate in 2021, it has put us in an excellent position to respond to our customers and deliver record sales, gross margin, operating profit and EBITDA during the fiscal 2021 second quarter.
As per quarter progressed, end market demand accelerated faster and to a greater degree than we originally anticipated, particularly in medical, electronics and industrial end markets. Nordson's dispense applications in the Industrial Precision Solutions segment, benefited from the pickup in industrial end markets as well as a sustained demand for food and beverage packaging. In the Advanced Technology Solutions segment, a data-centric economy where increasing demand for semiconductors and complex electronic devices drove the need for our test and inspection and fluid dispense products.
We have also started to see recovery in our medical intervention solution product lines as the out-patient surgeries are beginning to increase following the COVID-19-related slowdown. Our medical businesses continues to benefit from accelerated growth of single-use plastic fluid components for biopharmaceutical applications. I want to congratulate and thank the Nordson global team for achieving this record second quarter. I'm also proud of our teams' dedication to meet this accelerating demand while maintaining COVID-19 safety protocols and effectively managing supply chain and capacity constraints.
I'll speak more about the business in few moments, but first, I'll turn the call over to Joe to provide more detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter.
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. On Slide number 5, you see second quarter 2021 sales were $590 million, an increase of 11% over prior year's second quarter sales of $529 million. This double-digit growth is more than a bounce back. In fact, as Naga noted, this is a quarterly record for the company, breaking the previous record established in Q3 of 2017.
The sales increase was primarily related to 10% organic volume growth off of a relatively strong Q2 2020 performance, favorable foreign currency and a net negative impact from acquisitions and divestitures. The benefits from the Fluortek and vivaMOS acquisitions were more than offset by the negative headwind from the divestiture of the screws and barrels product line.
When excluding the divested product line in the prior year for comparability purposes, sales growth would have been 15% in the current year second quarter. Robust growth in electronics and consumer non-durable end markets as well as strengthening medical and industrial end markets were the primary drivers of this performance. From a geographic perspective, growth was strong in all regions, except Japan, which has been more heavily impacted by shutdowns related to the pandemic.
Gross profit totaled $338 million or 57% of sales in the quarter compared to $290 million or 55% of sales in the prior year. This 260 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by the combination of improved sales mix, volume leverage and benefits from structural cost reduction measures taken in fiscal 2020. The divested screws and barrels product line at the beginning of the fiscal second quarter was a significant contributor to the improved sales mix. It is noteworthy that a gross margin of 57% is a new quarterly company record.
Also records in the quarter were operating profit of $166 million or 28% of sales, a 33% increase from the prior year adjusted operating profit of $125 million, and EBITDA of $192 million or 33% of sales, which is 26% higher than the prior year EBITDA of $152 million. The incremental EBITDA margins were 65% in the quarter. Investors are starting to see the power of the NBS Next growth framework as it drives double-digit organic sales volume growth, improved sales mix, enhances manufacturing efficiency resulting in strong profitable growth.
Looking at non-operating expenses, net interest expense decreased $1 million or 17% from the prior year levels associated with reduced debt levels and a lower effective borrowing rate. Other net expense increased $3 million, largely driven by currency translation gains in the prior year that did not repeat in the current year. Tax expense totaled $32 million or an effective tax rate of 20% in the quarter. Net income in the quarter increased year-over-year 35% to $124 million or $2.12 per share, yet another quarterly company record. This significant growth is reflective of volume leverage driven by the 11% increase in sales as well as benefits from cost control measures and improved efficiencies.
Now let's turn to Slide 6 and 7 to review the second quarter 2021 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $299 million increased 6% compared to the prior year second quarter. The organic volume increase of 8% was driven by strong demand and flexible packaging and industrial coating product line. A strengthening euro and RMB also contributed to a 5% in currency benefit during the quarter. The divested screws and barrels product line was a negative 7% impact on the year-over-year sales growth. It's important to note that the segment sales are north of 2020 and 2019 levels when prior year balances are adjusted for the divested screws and barrels product line.
Operating profit in the segment was $104 million or 35% of sales compared to $77 million of adjusted operating profit in the prior year period. This 36% profit growth was driven by sales volume leverage associated with the 8% organic growth, favorable sales mix, improved manufacturing efficiency and lower year-over-year SG&A, including reduced travel expense that we continue to experience through the second quarter.
Moving now to Advanced Technology Solutions. Sales of $291 million increased approximately 18% compared to the prior year second quarter. This change included an organic increase of approximately 13% as well as increases of approximately 3% related to currency and 2% related to acquisitions. The increase in organic sales volume was driven by strong demand for test and inspection product lines serving electronics end market and fluid management product lines serving medical and industrial end markets. Also, as we forecasted on the first quarter call, we started to see the electronic dispense applications contributed to growth late in the quarter.
Second quarter 2021 operating profit for the segment was $77 million or 26% of sales. This increase of 30% over prior year operating margin of $59 million or 20% of sales was driven by sales volume leverage, favorable sales mix and the realization of benefits from cost control measures taken in fiscal 2020. It is encouraging to see the benefits of NBS Next driving the top-line organic growth and delivering strong incremental profit margins in both of our operating segments.
Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Page 8. We again ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet and sufficient available borrowing capacity. Cash totaled $133 million and net debt was $734 million, ending the quarter with a 1.2 times leverage ratio based on trailing 12-month EBITDA. Free cash flow in the quarter was strong at $94 million, and net income was 75% in the quarter, which was below normal levels, due primarily to a $50 million discretionary pension contribution. Improvements in working capital efficiency contributed favorably in the quarter. The year-to-date free cash flow is north of a 100%.
I will now turn the call back to Naga.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Joe. Let's turn to Slide 9. Again, thank you to the Nordson team for delivering this outstanding performance in the quarter. We hosted an Investor Day on March 30 to detail our long-term plans for making a strong Nordson even stronger. If you did not have a chance to participate in our Investor Day, the replay of the event is available on our website.
Now I'd like to summarize a few highlights. First and foremost, we described the strong growth drivers enabling Nordson's future profitable growth performance, including diverse end markets, new applications and emerging market. While our growth drivers are unique to each of our divisions, the diversity of our end markets and the high level of recurring revenue, made us resilient through fiscal 2020 and are strengthening in fiscal 2021 results.
At our Investor Day, we also reiterated our commitment to innovation, one of Nordson's key competitive advantages. Our customer intimate model gives us insight to the needs of our customers, and we develop our product roadmap as an enabler of their new technologies. In the presentation, we highlighted two of our newest products the ProBlue Flex Melter for packaging customers and the New Vantage integrated dispense and automation system, which is the first fully integrated wafer handling system designed for the semiconductor industry. In both cases, these new products are advancing automation, reducing cost and accelerating productivity. Both products contributed to record sales in the quarter.
To make a strong Nordson even stronger, we also spoke to the new competencies that we are building, notably the NBS Next growth framework. This data-driven framework is driving our decision making. We are already starting to see the benefits of our deployment of NBS Next. Last year, we announced structural cost reductions that were based on our strategic disciplined analysis. It also drove our decision to divest the screws and barrels product line at the beginning of the second quarter.
Simultaneously, we approved new investments in our top opportunities such as funding new equipment for our Loveland, Colorado facility to grow our biopharmaceutical components and building a new facility in Mexico to support the needs of our Nordson medical interventional solution products. These decisions are strengthening both our top and bottom line. Since been vaccinated, I have started to travel to our businesses. It is exciting to see the engagement of our teams deploying NBS Next to make data-driven decisions on how to delight our best customers or invest in the most innovative technology projects or prioritize top products in manufacturing operations.
Turning to Slide 10. NBS Next is a critical pillar of our new Ascend Strategy, which is designed to deliver top-tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. In addition to NBS Next, the other inter-connected pillars of the Ascend Strategy are owner mindset, Nordson's entrepreneurial division-led organization and winning teams, Nordson's Talent Strategy. It is also exciting to experience the progress we are making in each of these pillars. We now have all of our division leaders in place, and they are focused on building a deep and diverse bench of talent who will support our long-term growth.
The successful execution of the Ascend Strategy will help us achieve our long-term growth milestones of $3 billion in revenue and 30% EBITDA. This target will be achieved through a combination of organic growth within each segment as well as the acceleration of acquisitions. Clearly, the record second quarter and updated fiscal 2021 outlook demonstrate that we are off to a strong start toward achieving our long-term goals.
Now let's turn to our updated fiscal 2021 outlook on Slide 11. As we enter the fiscal third quarter, backlog is strong and trailing 12-week order entry is up double-digits above prior year levels across the majority of our product lines and geographic regions. For full year fiscal 2021, we expect sales growth to be approximately 8% to 10% over fiscal year 2020. Excluding the 3% headwind from the revenue of the divested screws and barrels product line in the prior year, our forecasted full year sales growth would be approximately 11% to 13%. Our forecasted sales growth combined with strategic actions taken around efficiency and cost is forecasted to deliver earnings in the range $7.20 to $7.50 per diluted share. The midpoint of this guidance reflects 34% earnings growth compared to prior year and a 25% increase over 2019 earnings.
Our current financial results signify more than the benefits of the recovery. Nordson wins because of the foundation of our precision technology focus, customer-centric model and diversified end markets. We are well positioned to benefit from the recovery, and our products remain a critical solution to our customers through the cycle ahead. Additionally, our management team is fully engaged in advancing the implementation of the Ascend Strategy which will establish a growth framework, entrepreneurial organization and a deep diverse team to drive sustainable profitable growth. As always, I want to thank our customers, employees and shareholders for your continued support.
With that, we will pause and take your questions.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Naga, we're hearing a lot about supply chain issues sort of impacting maybe some growth opportunities, particularly as we enter the back half. Any thoughts there in terms of what you're seeing at this point?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank you, Allison. From our standpoint, we've had some issues, but very limited around resin. From where we stand today, it is nearly non-material to our expectations in the back half of the year.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Perfect. And then I just want to go back to your comments on medical. Obviously, you're seeing an improvement there, and you mentioned the single point-of-use on the consumable side. Is your sense is that an inventory issue that people are replenishing inventories or is this sort of true demand kind of behind that what you're seeing today?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. In our single-use components, these are for biopharma applications, so think of vaccine, think of new biopharmaceuticals that are coming on the market. We truly see it is representative of the demand because this is a demand we have seen all through last year as well as this year. So we have very limited supply chain kind of restocking in this business. We sell mostly directly to our customers there.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Great. I'm just going to sneak one more in. Any mix issues to be mindful of in the back half of the year for you?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Joe, you want to take that one?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think -- Allison, good question. I do think that the mix was quite favorable when we looked at our Q2 performance. But when we looked at the forecast for the remainder of the year, again, it's pretty much a broad-based demand environment that we see as it relates to geographies and as you see the volume organic growth in both segments. So I would tell you there is no mix issues to be aware of heading into the back half that we see at this time.
Allison Poliniak-Cusic -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Perfect. Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies.
Saree Boroditsky -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Good morning, and congratulations on the great quarter. You had really great margin performance in IPS, could you just talk through if this is the right level to think about going forward given the divestiture? And how should we think about the benefit of lower travel that you mentioned?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Joe, will you take that?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I'll take that one, Naga. When you look at our IPS margins in the quarter and our Nordson record level margins in the quarter, we did benefit clearly from the volume leverage. And then the improved sales mix, when you think about that, the divestiture of the screw and barrel business had a significant impact. I would tell you at the Nordson level, that probably expands the margin to 150 to 200 basis points. And at the IPS level, you're talking about 300 to 400 basis points can be attributed to the improved sales mix tied to the divestiture of the screws and barrels product line. And so even excluding that, there is nice margin performance.
When we think about going forward, I do think there is a component, as I mentioned in the script, where expense will start to ramp up a little bit in the second half. Particularly if you think about our direct sales model with the travel and expense, T&E expense coming up, we'll begin to ramp a little bit more in the second half than we saw in the first half.
Saree Boroditsky -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Great. And then with leverage now at 1.2 times, really below your target range, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the M&A market or how you're thinking about share buybacks?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So on the M&A market, I would tell you, we remained very active in looking at deals. I will tell you there is a feeling in the market that the number of deals coming across has continues to, I would say, increase as we work through post-pandemic. And so we remained very active. Strategic discipline that we reviewed in our Investor Day is our primary filter. And then after we confirm strategic discipline, we put the financial criteria on and we remain financially disciplined.
So we are looking, as you know, for acquisition targets, primarily in the test and inspection in the medical space and we will continue to be active. So the volume, I would tell you, is picking up in terms of what it is we're looking at. As it relates to share buyback, we target to offset dilution. I will point out, Saree, that we did contribute additional $50 million to our defined benefit pension plans and our U.S. funded status is north of 98% and we did pay down $150 million debt in the quarter.
Saree Boroditsky -- Jefferies -- Analyst
Thanks for taking the question.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh -- Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC -- Analyst
Yeah, thanks. I was wondering if we could return to the supply chain conversation a little bit. So it sounds like availability is really not an issue for you. Are you seeing component cost inflation that you need to address with price or is that also relatively muted?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. When you think about inflation as it relates to Nordson, first of all, you have to think about our overall Nordson cost structure. And I would tell you, the material cost is a relatively small component of our overall cost structure. So manufacturing conversion cost, fixed manufacturing cost and SG&A represents a larger component than the material cost itself. We do have procedures and processes in place to address material cost increases with price where and when appropriate. But I would tell you, Connor, that the challenge is more on the labor cost potential inflation there or availability.
So when you think about the NBS Next initiatives and investments that we've made in in-lining and streamlining the manufacturing process, this is really helping us mitigate some of those pressures on both inflation and availability of the labor cost on the manufacturing side. And where availability isn't a problem, we're able to expand our capacity to serve this 10% volume growth. So that's the pressure, I would tell you, we're seeing is more on the labor side than on the material cost inflation side.
Connor Lynagh -- Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC -- Analyst
Okay. Got it. And then maybe just sticking with the cost maybe, you called out the discretionary expenditure headwind as we move toward -- further toward reopening. Could you maybe just give us an order of magnitude to think about? Is that at a Nordson level a 50 basis point, 100 basis point? How should we think about how significant that could be?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I would tell you, if you just look at the first half year-over-year, it's about probably a $5 million benefit in terms of travel and entertainment expense, particularly on our commercial sales force, direct sales model. So a portion of that's going to start to come back.
Connor Lynagh -- Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC -- Analyst
Okay, understood. And maybe just to tie this together with some of the questions that others have been asking. I mean, it seems like based on the EPS guidance that there is a certain degree of margin degradation, maybe some reversal of mix. Is that the right way to think about the back half outlook? Is that there could be some pressure on margin, but the top-line growth is strong?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So the top-line growth is strong. I think, as you're familiar, the mix in any given quarter could be favorable or unfavorable, and I do think in Q2 we did see a favorable mix. And so as it goes forward, that may moderate a little bit. And then I would tell you on the cost structure side, the expense -- some of that expense should start to come back.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Joe, let me add something to this. Connor, the best way to think about us is that our long-term incrementals on growth is 40% to 45%. We believe based [Technical Issue] guidance, we would still be north of that 40% to 45% incremental in the back half. So yes, there are some costs coming back, but still pretty solid performances what we are forecasting.
Connor Lynagh -- Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC -- Analyst
Got it. I appreciate the color. I'll turn it back.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Just on backlog, can you give us the backlog number and what that is up organically? I don't know if I missed that in the presentation.
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Jeff, these are abnormal times coming out of the pandemic. And when we're looking at our customers' behavior, our backlog, our order entry, we're seeing differences now in the timing of delivery. And so I don't think our backlog is indicative of the next quarter sales. What I can tell you is our backlog and our order entry are up double-digits. And therefore, we have confidence in the guidance that we provided. But to give a backlog number right now would not be appropriate I think.
Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
So the idea is that you're getting significant orders, but they're longer turnaround than normal?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We do see in particular businesses on the system side customers placing orders in advance. And so, therefore, with delivery times that go out actually into 2022, which is a little bit abnormal for our historical customer order patterns. So therefore, it's distorting that data point.
Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Okay. And then just -- maybe just to go back to IPS margins, just is there a way to give what the underlying core incremental margins were in the quarter? And I'm just trying to understand like outside of screw and barrel, like how much mix drove it versus some of this temp cost and kind of how you think about that in the second half because those were pretty eye-popping?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So when you think about the IPS business, in the quarter itself, I would tell you, the screw a barrel divestiture expanded margins roughly 300 to 400 basis points. So if we were 35% OP, you can drop that down, which is still a very strong, north of 30% operating profit number for that business. And so the way to think about that is the power of the leverage on the 8% organic growth within that segment.
And so, as Naga mentioned, very strong incremental margins in that business. Some favorable mix on the consumer non-durable as it relates to packaging, some favorable mix also within our industrial coatings segment, and it's also in this business, the industrial coatings, where we took some actions last year to structurally reduce our cost late in Q4. And so you see some of that benefit coming through as well.
Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Okay. And then just last one. You mentioned in Advanced Tech, the electronics precision dispense kind of picking up late in the quarter, maybe that's still lagging from a growth standpoint. But just talk about what you're seeing there from a forward kind of order quoting visibility? Thanks.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Joe, let me take that one and then you could give some color. Jeff, what we're beginning to see here is on the PCB side we are starting to pick up some pretty strong order patterns around surface treatment, our plasma surface systems -- surface treatment systems. Late in the quarter, we also began to see our fluid dispense product lines in electronics beginning to contribute across a diverse set of the electronic supply chain. Semiconductors certainly helping, PCB helping and complex electronic components also helping. So I would say, we feel pretty good about what we see in that business and expect it to contribute nicely in the quarters to come.
Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird.
Michael Halloran -- Baird Equity Research -- Analyst
Hey, good morning, everyone.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Michael Halloran -- Baird Equity Research -- Analyst
So on the medical side, maybe just some thoughts on elective versus non-elective, underlying trends that you're seeing today? And then how you think that inflection curve happens from here? Obviously, such a nice improvement this quarter. Is this kind of the right sustainable pace? And when do you think you're back to what a more normalized level would look like?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, when we would come to normalized levels, that is going to be difficult to predict, but let's talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the business right now. First and foremost, if you think about our biopharma side of the business where we have the fluid components, continues to be strong, has been strong, continues to be strong and mainly led by not only vaccine, but just the number of drugs that are getting manufactured and introduced from a biopharma perspective is just accelerating. We expect that part of the business continue to contribute in a nice way.
On the elective-selective surgery, what you're beginning to see is the COVID slowdown is certainly benefiting and you're beginning to see elective surgeries or selective surgeries, in our case, starting to pick up. We saw some nice growth in the business in the quarter. We expect that the next two quarters look pretty good. And it's really difficult for us to say would we get back to high-single-digits, which is normally what we expect out of this business in end of this year, early next year, it's difficult to say. But that's kind of how we're thinking about is that our expectation for the second half for this business is still pretty good.
Michael Halloran -- Baird Equity Research -- Analyst
And then maybe just a similar conversation in the industrial-facing end markets, underlying trajectory trend, any nuance that you're seeing within those pieces?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. The Industrial business is, as you can see, there is a certain amount of pent-up capex spending demand that we are certainly enjoying in the quarter. Based on backlogs and order entries we see, we expect a pretty double-digit kind of growth is what implies in our guidance for the full year. What is difficult for us to again pinpoint is that when this gets to a normalized level, that is something difficult to predict right now. But based on what we can see, we feel really good about the second half having a pretty broad-based performance across number of -- across all of our core end markets and across all of our geographies.
Michael Halloran -- Baird Equity Research -- Analyst
Thanks, Naga. Appreciate it.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer

The next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research.
Chris Dankert -- Longbow Research -- Analyst
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, thinking about the strong semiconductor demand we saw in the quarter, can you comment about kind of the mix there? Is this being more driven by strong product adoption of the T&I business or is this more customer expansion or combination of the two? Just any comments there would be great.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank you, Chris. We certainly benefit from our T&I business, which is having a really strong number of quarters and continues to benefit from this semi-investment and semi-growth. And also, the complexity of the semiconductors, complexity of electronic components as well, definitely benefiting the T&I business. But late in the quarter, we begin to see, as I indicated in the script, we're beginning to see contribution from our fluid dispense business as well. Our surface treatment product lines have been really well. We're beginning to have some very good progress in our coating as well as dispense product lines as well.
And so in terms of where we participate broadly, I will tell you in the semiconductor space. We participate first in the surface cleaning side of it. Second in the underfill in terms of packaging. In the past, a lot of this packaging happened post-wafer sliced and then packaging happened. But now, we are beginning to see packaging starting to move upfront and we are starting to participate there as well. So a pretty broad-based growth, Chris. I wouldn't pinpoint that to just semiconductor or just one particular product.
Chris Dankert -- Longbow Research -- Analyst
Got it. Got it. Thanks for the color. And then -- and not to put too fine a point on it, but is it safe to assume T&I was up double-digits in the quarter though?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Yes.
Chris Dankert -- Longbow Research -- Analyst
Okay, OK. And again, you called it out a little bit ago, very, very robust PCB demand and growth there. Is this part of the beginning of some of the 5G cycle in your opinion or is this just -- it's really much more broad-based than that?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We have spent quite a bit of time in the past year or two on a shift in the strategy in electronics for us is to get to a place where we have broad set of applications across the electronic supply chain. And so what I would tell you is the growth that we are seeing, the forecasting that we're thinking about, is a broad-based demand rather than a specific particular product.
Chris Dankert -- Longbow Research -- Analyst
Understood. Thanks so much, Naga.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Thank you, Chris.

The next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.
Matt J. Summerville -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst
Thanks. Just a follow-up on the whole -- the test and inspection piece of the business. What sort of anticipated duration do you see, Naga, in this cycle? What inning are we in? And do you expect that double-digit growth that you experienced in the second quarter to continue into the foreseeable future? What's the right way to kind of be thinking about that?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would say a typical semi-cycle is three to five years depending on what happens. And we would say we are probably in year one or little bit past year one. And so the best way to think about it is, early in the cycle, certainly, the growth is much more magnified than it is in the back half of the cycle. So that's -- it's very difficult to sort of pinpoint how many more quarters or year we have on this double-digit kind of growth. But over the cycle, the best way to think about our end market opportunity is 4% to 5%, which is kind of what we indicated in our Investor Day. We clearly are in the first leg of the growth is maybe the best way to think about it, Matt. Hopefully that helps you?
Matt J. Summerville -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst
Thanks. And then just one last one on pricing. With the strength in demand that you're seeing pretty much across the board in your business, double-digit growth in orders and backlog. Are you able to be more of a price-taker? Are you positioned to be so as we think about this going forward given the demand environment you're experiencing?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Let me maybe make one comment, and then, Joe, you could add a little bit more detail to it that would be very helpful. Think about the gross margin of the company. Pretty -- it's pretty strong, right? 55% plus, and that is indicative of the value we create for our customers. In some of our product lines we have a regular price increase once a year to sort of take into account inflation and things like that, but we really need to be thoughtful. We create value and we get paid for it. And should inflation become an issue, we will certainly have the opportunity to cover it. But in general, we feel good about where we are.
Joe, you want to add any more color to it?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Again, I would just say that we feel very good about our gross margins, a record 57% gross margin. We have processes in place to monitor raw material cost increase inflation and processes to maintain that margin. But I would tell you the best opportunity is to support this volume growth and to meet the customers' needs as opposed to take this opportunity to raise price because we're already running at very nice incremental margins, as Naga mentioned, as we look at the back half and this double-digit organic growth. As we think about it, we are managing the incremental margins to be attractive, and that's the best opportunity to support the organic growth and our customers.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
And maybe one more to think about this, just to reiterate Nordson's position. Typically, Nordson is the lowest cost, but a very critical component. Really small part of our customers' total cost deck, right? So our components are smaller part of the company -- customers' total cost deck. And so should we need to raise prices, we are able to provide that.
Matt J. Summerville -- D.A. Davidson & Co. -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you, guys.

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.
Christopher Glynn -- Oppenheimer & Company -- Analyst
Thanks. Good morning, all. Covered a lot of ground so far, I did want to follow-up on industrial demand patterns. You've seen any demand transitions within industrial recovery at this stage? And what I mean by that is, typically, early on, you just see a lot of production-oriented OEM activity and then more maybe mid-cycle-type capital improvements driven by different types of capacity coming online. Just wondering any light you could shed on how that's evolving?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. From what we can see, Chris, today is mostly what we're seeing is a demand pickup based on pent-up capex spending. And we've not seen significant capacity yet as yet.
Christopher Glynn -- Oppenheimer & Company -- Analyst
Okay, thanks.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure.

The next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg.
Andrew E. Buscaglia -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hey, guys. I know you got a lot of questions on these, the supply chain and navigating that. I think, I was hoping you could explain one thing in that, the headlines every day are these component shortages. I'm just wondering what the nature of your business and that you're able to kind of sidestep that? And correct me if I'm wrong, your business test and inspect various components and with coatings on other component. I just don't -- I don't quite understand, I guess, we would not have expected a quarter in which that have performed so well. So just any there.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Let me maybe give you some overall point of view and Joe can add a little bit more color to it at the end with some data. Think about Nordson from who we are, right? What we are is, we are an assembler of differentiated components to create value for our customers in specific end markets for critical applications. So what that really is, is that we are a assembler of value-added components. And what that really means is that, materials as a part of our total cost structure is fairly small. So that's one thing to keep in mind.
The second is that, we do manufacture our products in country, in region in most of the cases. So we really don't run into a lot of supply chain issues that way. So if you put those two things in perspective, I'm not saying we don't have any problems at all, we've had one or two issues here and there, but they're really not material is kind of what we're saying.
Andrew E. Buscaglia -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst
They're just so niche, we can't look at it -- you can't look at the broad -- the broader headlines. You're kind of too narrowly focused that really doesn't impact your teams?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And we're not a big processor of materials either, right? Yes, we have some consumable business, but we're not a big resin converter to contract manufacturing of injection-molded parts, that's not who we are, right?
Andrew E. Buscaglia -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst
Yeah. Okay. And then maybe, Naga, you put out that long-term target of 30% EBITDA margin. But it looks like you're -- I mean, this year you're going to brush close to that. I mean, I think you'd be into the 29, 529 based on the implied guidance. So I guess is the way to look at that long-term guidance more or like three or should we be looking at year-over-year EBITDA growth from like a dollar perspective or I guess -- or are you just being really conservative with being able to achieve 30% long-term because they're practically there after this year?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Joe can walk you through some of our thinking. But really, it is a long-term target. And what you're seeing now is only the impact of our organic growth this year. So -- and our long-term guidance includes organic growth and a dilution from acquisitions. So that is two things. We don't believe this is a conservative estimate. This is through the cycle. Over the five years, this is what we expect we will be.
Joe, would you add a little bit more color to that please?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I mean, I would just add, Andrew, that when you think about it, the organic growth has to drive margin expansion north of the 30% EBITDA line such that when that $500 million of acquired revenue comes in at a 20% EBITDA, the net dilution is down to the targeted 30%. So our 30% is still an appropriate goal. It just -- it includes the dilution of $500 million worth of acquisitions over the next five years at a 20% EBITDA.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Another way to think about is that for every dollar of growth in our expectations within the businesses and how -- where we are headed is that we're going to have 40% to 45% incremental. That's really what we're focused around. And so on a yearly basis, that's how we are thinking about it. And if you project that out over time with acquisitions, that's sort of how we come to this 30% EBITDA target.
Andrew E. Buscaglia -- Berenberg Capital Markets -- Analyst
Okay. Thank you, guys.

The final question comes from the line of Walt Liptak with Seaport Global Research.
Walter S. Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst
Hey, good morning, guys. Good quarter.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Good morning. Thank you.
Walter S. Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst
I want to follow-up on a couple of things. When you were talking about the backlog earlier, you were saying that there were some systems that were booking out 2022. I wonder if you can give us some idea of which segments those might be in and why they were running so low -- so long? Is it just timing of when these things are supposed to get it sold or is there something else going on?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Walt, I would just tell you, our understanding is that it's into the macroeconomic environment where people are hearing what's been discussed on this phone call as it relates to supply chain challenges. And so some of our customers are, I think, responding back and placing orders in advance of when they would typically place orders. So they're not building orders or building inventory, they're just placing their orders with us earlier than they used to. And so that's what we view is going on and why we're choosing not to disclose the backlog number at this time.
Walter S. Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst
Okay, I understand. Can you give us some color though about which segment or is it kind of across the board where customers are just concerned about future delays, so they're sort of pre-placing these orders?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would tell you, we see it a little bit in both of our segments. And so it's not one segment specific. And it's generally tied to those products that typically have a longer lead time naturally that they're calling in and ordering in advance of those, and that's why I made the comment about the systems. As it relates to the parts business, you know, many of those it's booked and shipped within the week. And so there we don't have that built up backlog.
Walter S. Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst
Okay, great. And as you're pulling out the gross margin that's absolutely great, and I understand that early in the cycle there are some things that are abnormal. But as we're looking at the back half of the year, is this 57% a reasonable run rate given what you're seeing from volume levels and mix?
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think that 57%, I would tell you, is a new high watermark. But I do think that a lot of what drove it is sustainable. And when you think about the impact on the divestiture and improved mix, the divestiture of screw and barrel business, you think about the benefits of the cost structure actions that we took last year and at these increased demand levels, this is the type of leverage you would expect with strong incremental margins. And so, you know, on any given quarter that can fluctuate up or down 100 to 200 basis point based on mix. But I think this is reflective of the profitability of this business at these sales levels.
Walter S. Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst
Okay, great. And then maybe a last one from me is just, I think it was in Naga's comments, you made a comment early on that the majority of the products are growing double-digits and some of those elective surgery, medical are not growing double-digits. So I wonder if you could talk about what else is not growing double-digits? And if you think you can get a together recovery in those in the back half of the year?
Joseph P. Kelley -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I guess, let me take a stab at it and then Naga can add some more color. But when you look at a geographic split, Walt, I would tell you the one that was not growing double-digits in the quarter organically was Japan. There, our business experienced -- in that region that experienced significant shutdowns due to the pandemic. And so we did deliver double-digit organic growth in Japan. But I think the comment then, going back to your question on the electronics and the medical, I think if you look at our performance over the last several quarters, the medical was driven by the biopharma in the single fluid component, single-use application.
And what we started to see late in the quarter was the growth of the interventional solutions, which is encouraging because that's the one that's more closely tied to elective procedures or selective procedures. And so it was encouraging to see that come back. On the electronic space, T&I had been the strong performer, and it was encouraging to see the electronics dispense portion of that business come back and contribute to growth in the later part of Q2. And so that was the comment there.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Walt, one other thing I would add is that if you compare the growth rate year-over-year, remember, last year, Nordson's growth performance or declines were not as deep as -- we were down about 4%. So double-digit growth we are seeing is on path of what was not a too bad of a decline last year given sort of the broader environment.
Walter S. Liptak -- Seaport Global -- Analyst
Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you very much, guys.
Operator
I will now turn the call back over to Naga for closing remarks.
Sundaram Nagarajan -- President and Chief Executive Officer

More NDSN analysis
All earnings call transcripts","Nordson Corporation experienced significant growth in its fiscal 2021 second quarter, according to the company's latest earnings call. The strategic approach has proved fruitful, leading to record sales, gross margin, operating profit, and EBITDA during the quarter. The notable growth was attributed to increased end-market demand, particularly in the medical, electronics, and industrial sectors, with significant contributions from the company’s dispense and precision solutions segments. 
  
Financially, the corporation reported an 11% increase in sales, reaching $590 million for the quarter, up from $529 million in the prior year's same period. This growth was driven mainly by organic volume growth, aided by favorable foreign currency effects and despite some negative impact from acquisitions and divestitures. The company achieved a new quarterly record gross margin of 57%, owing to improved sales mix, volume leverage, and cost reduction measures initiated in fiscal 2020.  
 
On a segment basis, the Industrial Precision Solutions segment saw a 6% increase in sales, while the Advanced Technology Solutions segment experienced an 18% increase, reflecting strong demand in key markets such as electronics and medical. Both segments contributed to the overall profitability through organic growth, favorable sales mix, and cost control measures. 
  
Looking ahead, Nordson remains optimistic, updating its full-year fiscal 2021 guidance to anticipate sales growth of 8-10% over the previous fiscal year. The company attributes its resilient performance and positive outlook to its diversified market presence, strategic focus on innovation, and the successful execution of its growth framework."
